     ON SATURDAY, MARCH 19, 1994, AT 0950 EASTERN STANDARD TIME, A HUGHES 369A, N97LC, REGISTERED TO THE LAKE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE, AND PILOTED BY DEPUTY SHERIFF WILLIAM J. MARIE, WAS DESTROYED DURING IMPACT WITH TREES AND THE TERRAIN IN NORTHFORD, CONNECTICUT.  THE PILOT WAS FATALLY INJURED.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED, AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED.  THE FLIGHT WAS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER 14 CFR PART 91.

     N97LC DEPARTED THE QUONSET STATE AIRPORT, KINGSTON, RHODE ISLAND, ABOUT 0840, ON A FERRY FLIGHT TO LEESBURG, FLORIDA,  WITH THE FIRST DESTINATION OF MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY FOR REFUELING.  THE HELICOPTER HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED FROM THE RHODE ISLAND ARMY NATIONAL GUARD TO THE LAKE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE, AS PART OF A SURPLUS AIRCRAFT PROGRAM BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND THE DRUG LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.  

     THE PILOT OF N97LC WAS FLYING LOOSE FORMATION WITH ANOTHER HELICOPTER, WHICH HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO A DIFFERENT SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN FLORIDA.  THE TWO HELICOPTERS WERE MAINTAINING RADIO AND VISUAL CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER.  

     NO DISTRESS CALLS FROM THE PILOT OF N97LC WERE HEARD BY THE PILOTS OF THE LEAD HELICOPTER.

     A WITNESS STATED:

          ...MY WIFE AND I BOTH HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A           TURBO PROP SCREAMING.  IT SEEMED TO BE COMING           FROM EAST TO WEST.  I LOOKED OUT MY WINDOW AND           SAW A CHOPPER NOW GOING NORTH TO SOUTH JUST OVER           THE TREE TOPS.  I ALSO SAW ANOTHER ONE HEADED           WEST ABOUT 1000 TO 1500 FT HIGH DUE WEST....            [THE HELICOPTER HEADING NORTH TO SOUTH] WAS ON A           GRADUAL DECLINE MAKING A SCREAMING  NOISE.  I            WATCHED IT UNTIL IT WENT OUT OF SIGHT, BUT I           DID HEAR A CRASH OR IMPACT SHORTLY...

     ANOTHER WITNESS SAID:

          ...I NOTICED A SMALL HELICOPTER COMING FROM THE            NORTH BEHIND MY HOUSE.  I DID NOT HEAR THE ENGINES.           I ONLY SAW THE...TOP ROTOR BLADES WERE NOT ROTATING           FAST...THIS HELICOPTER WAS ON A STEADY DECLINE...IT           WAS BELOW THE TREE TOPS....I COULD TELL IT WAS IN           TROUBLE AND GOING TO CRASH....THE HELICOPTER WAS           NOSE DOWN AND JUST BEFORE IT CRASHED IT TURNED           TO THE LEFT.  IT DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE TREES AND           THEN I SAW...SMOKE COME FROM...WHERE IT WENT DOWN.

     THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED DURING THE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT, AT ABOUT 41 DEGREES, 25 MINUTES NORTH; 73 DEGREES, 0 MINUTES WEST.  

PILOT INFORMATION

     MR. MARIE HELD AN AIRLINE TRANSPORT PILOT CERTIFICATE, WITH MULTIENGINE LAND, SINGLE ENGINE LAND AND SEA, AND ROTORCRAFT- HELICOPTER RATINGS.  IN ADDITION, HE HELD A FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR CERTIFICATE, WITH AIRPLANE SINGLE ENGINE AND ROTORCRAFT- HELICOPTER RATINGS.  

     THE PILOT WAS ISSUED A FIRST CLASS AIRMAN'S MEDICAL CERTIFICATE, ON NOVEMBER 19, 1993, WITH NO RESTRICTIONS.

     AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, MR. MARIE HAD A TOTAL FLIGHT TIME OF 8250 HOURS, OF WHICH 415 HOURS WERE IN HELICOPTERS.  ON MARCH 18, 1994, HE FLEW WHAT WAS DESCRIBED AS AN ""ORIENTATION"" FLIGHT IN N97LC, WITH A PILOT FROM THE RHODE ISLAND NATIONAL GUARD.  THIS PILOT HELD AN FAA FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR CERTIFICATE (CFI).  AT THE COMPLETION OF THIS 1.1 HOUR FLIGHT, THE CFI, AT THE REQUEST OF MR. MARIE, COMPLETED AND SIGNED FAA FORM 8410-3, AIRMAN COMPETENCY/PROFICIENCY CHECK, INDICATING THE TYPE OF CHECK AS A BFR (BIANNUAL FLIGHT REVIEW).  

     MR. MARIE'S PILOT LOGBOOK INDICATED THAT HE HAD NO OTHER HELICOPTER FLIGHT TIME SINCE DECEMBER 10, 1988.  ACQUAINTANCES AND CO-WORKERS OF THE PILOT STATED THAT THEY ""THOUGHT"" MR. MARIE HAD FLOWN SOME TYPE OF HELICOPTER IN THE PAST 2 OR 3 YEARS.  DURING THE INVESTIGATION, NO RECORD OR CONFIRMATION OF SUCH FLIGHTS WERE LOCATED.  A REVIEW OF HIS LOGBOOK REVEALED THE FOLLOWING HELICOPTER FLIGHT TIME:

     MR. MARIE RECEIVED NO ""FORMAL"" GROUND TRAINING IN THIS AIRCRAFT.  HE HAD OBTAINED OH-6A TECHNICAL MANUALS, INCLUDING THE OPERATORS MANUAL, FROM THE ARMY NATIONAL GUARD, AND ACCORDING TO A FAMILY MEMBER AND WORKING ASSOCIATES, MR. MARIE HAD STUDIED THESE MANUALS PRIOR TO THE FERRY FLIGHT.    

     MR. MARIE HAD NO FLIGHT TIME IN THE HUGHES 369A PRIOR TO THE FLIGHT ON MARCH 18, 1994.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

     N97LC WAS DELIVERED TO THE UNITED STATES ARMY ON AUGUST 20, 1968, AS AN OH-6A, TAIL NUMBER 67-16334.  IT HAD ACCUMULATED A TOTAL OF 4082 HOURS ON THE AIRFRAME.  THE ENGINE WAS CHANGED, ON JANUARY 26, 1994, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE LAKE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE AN AIRCRAFT WITH MORE FLIGHT TIME BEFORE ENGINE OVERHAUL.  

     THE RHODE ISLAND ARMY NATIONAL GUARD MAINTENANCE OFFICER STATED IN A WRITTEN REPORT:

          THE REASON FOR THE ENGINE CHANGE IN AIRCRAFT S/N           67-16334 WAS TO TRANSFER THE AIRCRAFT WITH            AN ENGINE HAVING LESS OPERATING TIME.  THE           ENGINE REMOVED HAD APPROXIMATELY 150 HOURS            REMAINING UNTIL TBO (TIME BETWEEN OVERHAUL).            THE ENGINE THAT WAS INSTALLED HAD 837 HOURS           REMAINING UNTIL TBO AT THE TIME OF INSTALLATION           ....

          THE AIRCRAFT WAS STORED IN A HANGER PROTECTED           FROM THE ELEMENTS....

          AFTER INSTALLATION, GROUND OPERATION WAS CONDUCTED           TO ACCOMPLISH THE NECESSARY MAINTENANCE OPERATIONAL           CHECKS AND ENGINE VIBRATION CHECKS.  A MAINTENANCE           TEST FLIGHT WAS CONDUCTED ON 15 MARCH TO INCLUDE           AN ENGINE PERFORMANCE CHECK....THE AIRCRAFT WAS           FUELED, SERVICED, AND PARKED UNTIL 18 MARCH WHEN           IT WAS FLOWN AS AN ORIENTATION FLIGHT BY A           FACILITY INSTRUCTOR PILOT AND THE INDIVIDUAL           THAT WAS TO ACCOMPLISH THE...FERRY FLIGHT.

     THE AIRCRAFT AND ENGINE MAINTENANCE RECORDS WERE ON THE AIRCRAFT AND WERE DESTROYED BY POST-IMPACT FIRE.

WRECKAGE

     THE WRECKAGE WAS EXAMINED AT THE ACCIDENT SITE ON MARCH 19, 1994.  ALL THE WRECKAGE WAS CONTAINED IN AN AREA ABOUT 106 FEET LONG.  THERE WERE TREES ABOUT 25 FEET HIGH WITH BROKEN BRANCHES.  APPROXIMATELY 25 FEET FROM THESE TREES ON A MAGNETIC HEADING OF 120 DEGREES, THE LEFT SKID WAS BURIED IN MUD AT AN ANGLE OF ABOUT 45 DEGREES.  ON THE SAME MAGNETIC HEADING, AND ABOUT 30 FEET AWAY, A MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS BURIED IN THE MUD ABOUT 1/3 ITS LENGTH AT AN 80 DEGREE ANGLE.  THE MAIN WRECKAGE WAS LOCATED   25 FEET FROM THIS BLADE ON A MAGNETIC HEADING OF ABOUT 120 DEGREES.  IT WAS INVERTED IN A MUDDY, SNOW COVERED, MARSHY AREA. 

     THERE WAS AN OPEN FIELD APPROXIMATELY 75 FEET FROM THE WRECKAGE, ON A MAGNETIC HEADING OF 180 DEGREES.

     THE FUEL CELL WAS RUPTURED AND WAS ON THE TOP OF THE WRECKAGE.  A POST-IMPACT FIRE HAD OCCURRED.  THE FUEL SHUTOFF VALVE WAS NOT LOCATED.

     THREE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE LOCATED WITH THE MAIN WRECKAGE. THE BLADES WERE BENT, BUT NONE OF THE ROTOR BLADES EXHIBITED LEADING EDGE MARKS, NICKS OR CHORD-WISE SCRATCHES.   

     THE TAIL ROTOR ASSEMBLY WAS LOCATED 26 FEET BEYOND THE MAIN WRECKAGE ON THE SAME MAGNETIC HEADING.  IT WAS FRACTURED AT ABOUT STATION NUMBER 250.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF BLADE STRIKES ON THE BOOM ASSEMBLY.  THE FRACTURES SURFACES WERE TWISTED AND BENT. THE TAIL ROTOR BLADES WERE INTACT, AND THERE WERE NO LEADING EDGE GAUGES, NICKS OR CHORD-WISE SCRATCHES ON THESE BLADES.    

     THE ENGINE WAS LOCATED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WRECKAGE AND WAS DAMAGED BY FIRE.    

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

     AN AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED ON THE PILOT BY DR. H. WAYNE CARVER, II, CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER, ON MARCH 20, 1994, AT THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER, FARMINGTON, CONNECTICUT.

     TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING WAS PERFORMED BY DR. RICHARD D. PINDER, DIRECTOR, TOXICOLOGY LABORATORY, AT THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER, FARMINGTON, CONNECTICUT, ON MARCH 21, 1994.  THE RESULTS OF THIS TESTING WERE NEGATIVE FOR ALCOHOL, DRUGS AND CARBON MONOXIDE.  

TESTS AND RESEARCH

     THE U.S. ARMY SAFETY CENTER, ANALYTICAL INVESTIGATION BRANCH, CORPUS CHRISTI, TEXAS, EXAMINED THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS/PARTS FROM N97LC:

          1.   MAIN DRIVE SHAFT           2.   OVERRUNNING CLUTCH           3.   MAIN ROTOR HEAD           4.   MAIN ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT AND STATIC MAST           5.   MAIN ROTOR SWASHPLATE/SCISSORS/TRANSMISSION           6.   TAIL ROTOR/GEARBOX/ASSEMBLY           7.   A 16"" PIECE OF TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT           8.   FLIGHT CONTROL TUBES           9.   MISCELLANEOUS LIGHT BULBS

     IN A REPORT, THE ARMY SAFETY CENTER STATED:

                    CONCLUSIONS

          A.   EXAMINATION OF THE COMPONENTS/PARTS      DISCLOSED THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:

               (1)  THE DAMAGE NOTED (DENTS, BENDS,            SCARS, AND TEARS) ON THE TAIL ROTOR BLADES,           AND THE MAIN ROTOR HEAD, INDICATED THAT THE            DRIVE TRAIN WAS AT A LOW OR NO ROTOR SPEED           WHEN IT ENTERED THE TREES AND IMPACTED THE            GROUND.

               (2)  THE OVERRUNNING CLUTCH FAILED TO SHOW           EVIDENCE OF A SPRAG ""ROLL OVER"" OR ANY OTHER            ANOMALIES.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS           NOT ESTABLISHED IN A CONTROLLED AUTOROTATION           FLIGHT DURING THE IMPACT SEQUENCE.

               (3)  BOTH MAIN DRIVE SHAFT FLEXIBLE DIAPHRAGMS           SEVERED AT THEIR OUTBOARD ENDS.  THE FRACTURES AT THE           SEVERED ENDS WERE DUE TO OVERLOAD/OVERSTRESS.

          B.   ALL OTHER BEND, TEARS, AND FRACTURES OCCURRED           AS A RESULT OF CONTACT WITH THE TREES OR IMPACT           WITH THE GROUND.

          C.   EXAMINATION OF THE LIGHT BULBS REVEALED THAT           THE BULBS WERE NOT ILLUMINATED  AT THE TIME THEIR           FILAMENTS FRACTURED OR DEFORMED.

     THE EXAMINATION OF THESE COMPONENTS/PARTS DID NOT REVEAL ANY ANOMALIES.

     THE ENGINE WAS EXAMINED AT THE ALLISON ENGINE COMPANY, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA, ON APRIL 14, 1994, UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE SAFETY BOARD INVESTIGATOR-IN-CHARGE.  

     THE MAGNESIUM GEARBOX SECTION WAS DESTROYED BY POST-IMPACT FIRE.  THE DRIVE GEARS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR, AND NO GEAR TEETH WERE MISSING OR BROKEN.

     THE STARTER/GENERATOR WAS DAMAGED BY FIRE.

     THE COMPRESSOR SECTION WAS NEARLY SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN HOUSING.

     THE FUEL PUMP WAS BURNED AND THE SHAFT COULD NOT BE ROTATED.

     THE N2 SHAFT WAS SEIZED AND WOULD NOT ROTATE. THE N1 SHAFT ROTATED FREELY.  THERE WERE NO MISSING/DISTORTED BLADES ON THE TURBINE.

     THE N0. 5 BEARING WAS SEIZED.  IT ROTATED AFTER THE APPLICATION OF HEAT BY INVESTIGATORS.  

     DISTORTION OF THE TURBINE BLADES AND RUBBING MARKS ON THE  SHROUD ASSOCIATED WITH ROTATIONAL DAMAGE WERE NOT PRESENT.  THE TURBINE BLADES WERE NOT BENT OPPOSITE TO THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION.  

     THERE WAS ""SOOT"" ON THE OUTER COMBUSTION CASE AND THE FUEL NOZZLES AND IGNITERS.  

     DURING THIS EXAMINATION, NO ANOMALIES WERE NOTED.

     THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS/PARTS WERE SECURED AND LEFT AT THE ALLISON ENGINE COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION:

     1.   FUEL PUMP      2.   GAS PRODUCER FUEL CONTROLLER      3.   FUEL NOZZLE      4.   PC AIR FILTER      5.   FUEL LINE TO THE FUEL PUMP INLET      6.   POWER TURBINE GOVERNOR      7.   TURBINE NOZZLE

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

     THE MCDONNELL DOUGLAS PILOT TRAINING SYLLABUS FOR MD 500 (WHICH INCLUDED THE HUGHES 369A) SERIES AIRCRAFT RECOMMENDED THE FOLLOWING:

     LESSON #1 - FAMILIARIZATION:             1.0 - 1.5 HOURS

     LESSON #2 - HOVER & PATTERN WORK:        1.0 - 1.5  ""

     LESSON #3 - EMERGENCY PROCEDURES:              1.5  ""                       (AUTOROTATIONS)      

     LESSON #4 - FAILURE INDICATIONS/EMERGENCIES    1.0  ""

                                   TOTAL:      4.5 - 5.5 HOURS

     THE UNITED STATES ARMY PUBLICATION, TC-215, QUALIFICATION TRAINING FOR HELICOPTER PILOTS TRANSITIONING TO THE OH-6A AIRCRAFT, STATED:

          DURING FLIGHT TRAINING, THE AVIATOR IS TRAINED           TO PROFICIENCY IN THE BASE TASKS IDENTIFIED IN           CHAPTER 5.  MINIMUM FLIGHT TIME WILL NOT BE LESS            THAN TEN HOURS.

     THE FOLLOWING EXCERPTS ARE FROM A BOOK BY R.W. PROUTY, ENTITLED HELICOPTER AERODYNAMICS.

          THE FACT THAT A SINGLE ENGINE HELICOPTER           HAS A MUCH BETTER CHANCE TO MAKE A SAFE           LANDING FOLLOWING A POWER FAILURE THAN A            SINGLE-ENGINE AIRPLANE...COMES UP IN MORE            GENERAL DISCUSSION THAN ANY OTHER TALKING           POINT.

          FAILURE TO MAKE A GOOD ENTRY INTO AUTOROTATION           AFTER THE ENGINE STOPS IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY            CAUSES OF HELICOPTER ACCIDENTS.  THE KEY TO           MAKING A GOOD ENTRY IS TO KEEP THE ROTOR SPEED           UP.  IF THE RPM IS ALLOWED TO DECAY TOO MUCH,            THE ROTOR MAY STALL AND COME TO A FATAL STOP           WHEN ASKED TO SUPPORT THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE           HELICOPTER....

          THE ACCEPTED WAY TO STOP THE DECAY IS TO QUICKLY           REDUCE THE POWER DEMANDS ON THE ROTOR BY LOWERING            THE COLLECTIVE STICK.  THIS RESULTS IN AN INITIAL           LOSS OF THRUST BUT DOES GET THE HELICOPTER GOING           DOWN THROUGH THE AIR - THE FIRST PREREQUISITE           FOR AUTOROTATION.

     IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY PUBLICATION, FUNDAMENTALS OF FLIGHT, DATED OCTOBER, 1988, IT STATED:

          ENTRY INTO AUTOROTATION IS PERFORMED AFTER           LOSS OF ENGINE POWER....IN MOST HELICOPTERS,           IT TAKES ONLY SECONDS FOR THE RPM DECAY TO           FALL INTO A MINIMUM SAFE RANGE.  AVIATORS           MUST QUICKLY REDUCE COLLECTIVE PITCH TO PREVENT           EXCESSIVE RPM DECAY.          

     IN THE EMERGENCY PROCEDURES CHAPTER OF THE UNITED STATES OPERATORS MANUAL FOR THE OH-6A, TM 55-1520-214-10, IT STATED:

          COMPLETE POWER LOSS.  UNDER A COMPLETE POWER LOSS           CONDITION, DELAY IN RECOGNITION OF THE MALFUNCTION,           IMPROPER TECHNIQUE OR EXCESSIVE MANEUVERING TO           REACH A SUITABLE LANDING AREA REDUCES THE PROB-           ABILITY OF A SAFE AUTOROTATIONAL LANDING.  

     THE AIRCRAFT WRECKAGE WAS RELEASED TO CHARLES M. BOWMAN, THE INSURANCE ADJUSTER, ON MARCH 22, 1994.","THE ARMY NATIONAL GUARD HAD TRANSFERRED THE HELICOPTER TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THE DAY PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.  THE HELICOPTER WAS CRUISING ABOUT 800 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL IN LOOSE FORMATION WITH ANOTHER HELICOPTER, WHEN RADIO AND VISUAL CONTACT WERE LOST. WITNESSES SAW THE HELICOPTER IN A DESCENT AND OBSERVED IT IMPACT TREES.  NO DISTRESS CALLS WERE HEARD FROM THE PILOT.  EVIDENCE INDICATED THAT THE MAIN AND TAIL ROTOR BLADES WERE AT LOW RPM.  EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE AND COMPONENTS INDICATED LOW POWER AT IMPACT.  NO DISCREPANCIES WERE NOTED DURING THE EXAMINATION.  A POST IMPACT FIRE DESTROYED MAJOR PORTIONS OF THE ENGINE AND FUSELAGE.  THE PILOT FLEW WITH A FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR FOR 1.1 HOURS THE DAY BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.  THIS WAS THE PILOT'S ONLY FLIGHT TIME IN THIS MODEL HELICOPTER PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. ALSO, OTHER THAN THIS FLIGHT, HE HAD NOT FLOWN ANY HELICOPTER IN OVER 5 YEARS.","THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS, AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ROTOR RPM DURING THE FORCED LANDING AUTOROTATION, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND COLLISION WITH TREES. ALSO CAUSAL TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S LACK OF RECENT HELICOPTER EXPEREINCE AND HIS LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS MODEL HELICOPTER."

ON MAY 10, 1994, APPROXIMATELY 0815 CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME, A BELL 206L-3 HELICOPTER, N5844, WAS DESTROYED NEAR INTRACOASTAL CITY, LOUISIANA, WHEN IT IMPACTED THE WATER IN AN UNCONTROLLED DESCENT. THE AIRLINE TRANSPORT RATED PILOT AND FOUR PASSENGERS RECEIVED FATAL INJURIES.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED FOR THE COMPANY TITLE 14 CFR PART 91 FLIGHT.

ACCORDING TO TOCA NEW ORLEANS (FLIGHT FOLLOWING) RECORDS, THE PILOT'S ROUTE OF FLIGHT WAS FROM ACADIANA REGIONAL AIRPORT (ARA), ERATH HELISTOP (LA70), THEN TO VERMILLION 149 IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.  THE OPERATOR REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS THE THIRD AIRCRAFT TO DEPART ERATH HELISTOP EN ROUTE TO VERMILION 149 FOR CREW CHANGE.  AT 0830 A RADIO CALL WAS MADE TO THE PILOT TO COORDINATE THE CREW CHANGE AT VERMILLION 149.  THERE WAS NO RESPONSE.  AT 0845, 5 MINUTES AFTER HIS ETA, A FORMAL RADIO SEARCH WAS STARTED.

A SEARCH ALONG THE INTENDED ROUTE OF FLIGHT TOWARDS THE BEACH COMMENCED AT 0850.  THE HELICOPTER WAS LOCATED AT 0927 APPROXIMATELY ONE MILE FROM SHORE.

PERSONNEL INFORMATION

THE AIRLINE TRANSPORT RATED PILOT ACCUMULATED 2,776 HOURS OF FLYING IN THE VICINITY AND OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO WHILE BEING EMPLOYED BY PETROLEUM HELICOPTERS, INC., AND SOUTHERN NATURAL GAS.

THE PILOT COMPLETED VFR AND IFR REFRESHER TRAINING AT THE BELL HELICOPTER CUSTOMER TRAINING ACADEMY ON APRIL 19, 1994.  SEE THE  ENCLOSED TRAINING RECORD.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

A REVIEW OF THE AIRFRAME AND ENGINE RECORDS DID NOT REVEAL ANY ANOMALIES OR UNCORRECTED MAINTENANCE DEFECTS.  AN ESTIMATE OF THE WEIGHT OF THE HELICOPTER AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT PLACED THE HELICOPTER WITHIN ITS WEIGHT AND BALANCE LIMITS.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER WAS LOCATED SOUTH OF INTRACOASTAL CITY, LOUISIANA, APPROXIMATELY ONE MILE OFF SHORE IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AT LATITUDE 29 DEGREES 34.4 MINUTES NORTH AND LONGITUDE 92 DEGREES 08.9 MINUTES WEST.  ALL AIRCRAFT MAJOR COMPONENTS WERE LOCATED WITHIN 100 FEET RADIUS OF THE WRECKAGE.  NUMEROUS LIGHT PIECES OF THE AIRCRAFT FLOATED TO THE NEARBY SHORE.  

THE SECTION FROM THE CABIN NOSE TO THE BULKHEAD BEHIND THE CARGO AND PASSENGER COMPARTMENT WAS SEPARATED FROM BELOW THE TRANSMISSION DECK TO THE BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT.  THE PITOT TUBE WAS BENT DOWN AND AFT.  THE SKIDS WERE SEPARATED FROM THE FUSELAGE, AND THE FLOATS WERE NOT INFLATED.

THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE GRIP/HUB ASSEMBLY.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF MAST BUMPING.  THE TRANSMISSION INPUT COUPLING DRIVESHAFT ASSEMBLY WAS FRACTURED AND THE SHAFT WAS BENT.

THE TAIL ROTOR GEAR BOX AND VERTICAL STABILIZER WERE SEPARATED FROM THE TAIL BOOM.  THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE VERTICAL STABILIZER WAS SPLIT APART.  THE TAIL BOOM JUST FORWARD OF THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER WAS BUCKLED ON THE BOTTOM SIDE AND THE SKIN WAS TORN.  THE FIVE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT SEGMENTS WERE STILL ATTACHED TO THE OIL COOLER FAN SHAFT AND TAIL BOOM.  THERE WERE MARKINGS ON TOP OF THE LEFT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER THAT CORRESPONDED TO MARKS ON THE BOTTOM OF ONE MAIN ROTOR BLADE.  

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

THE AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED BY EMIL M. LAGA, M.D., NEW IBERIA, LOUISIANA.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY PREEXISTING DISEASE THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT.  TOXICOLOGICAL FINDINGS WERE NEGATIVE.

TEST AND RESEARCH

DURING A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE HELICOPTER AT AIR SALVAGE OF DALLAS, IN LANCASTER, TEXAS, ON MAY 16, 1994, A METALLURGIST FROM BELL HELICOPTER-TEXTRON, BY DIRECTION, EXAMINED FRACTURED SURFACES OF COMPONENTS, AND CONCLUDED THEY WERE THE RESULT OF OVERLOAD FORCES.  FLIGHT CONTROL CONTINUITY WAS ESTABLISHED TO ALL FLIGHT CONTROLS. 

A DISASSEMBLY INSPECTION OF THE ALLISON MODEL 250-C30P, S/N 895528 GAS TURBINE ENGINE, AT AVIALL, INC, IN DALLAS, TEXAS, ON JULY 5, 1994, DID NOT REVEAL ANY ANOMALIES THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE ACCIDENT.  EVIDENCE OF ENGINE ROTATION AT IMPACT WAS DENOTED BY RUBBING CONTACT BETWEEN THE COMPRESSOR IMPELLER (CENTRIFUGAL) AND THE STATIONARY COMPRESSOR SHROUD.  ADDITIONAL ROTATIONAL INDICATIONS WERE EVIDENCED BY RUB CONTACT BETWEEN THE SHROUDED TIPS OF THE THIRD AND FOURTH STAGE TURBINE BLADES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE BLADE PATHS.  METALLURGICAL EVALUATIONS AT ALLISON ENGINE COMPANY, IN INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA, OF THE NO. 8 NOZZLE SHIELD, FIRST STAGE TURBINE NOZZLE, AND FIRST AND SECOND STAGE TURBINE WHEEL DID NOT REVEAL EVIDENCE OF ALUMINUM SPLATTER.

A DISASSEMBLY INSPECTION OF THE BENDIX FUEL CONTROL, S/N BR52711 AND THE BENDIX POWER TURBINE GOVERNOR, S/N BR37064, AT BENDIX ENGINE CONTROLS, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, DID NOT REVEAL ANY SIGNIFICANT ANOMALIES.

ON SEPTEMBER 28, 1994, AT 0947 EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME, A ROBINSON R-22B HELICOPTER, N83112, COLLIDED WITH THE GROUND AFTER THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM STRUCK THE TAIL BOOM OF THE HELICOPTER NEAR KNIGHTDALE, NORTH CAROLINA. THE BUSINESS FLIGHT OPERATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 14 CFR PART 91, WITH NO FLIGHT PLAN FILED. VISUAL WEATHER CONDITIONSPREVAILED AT THE TIME AND LOCATION  OF THE ACCIDENT. THE HELICOPTER WAS DESTROYED DURING THE INFLIGHT BREAKUP SEQUENCE AND A POST IMPACT FIRE; THE PILOT WAS FATALLY INJURED. THE FLIGHT DEPARTED RALEIGH EAST AIRPORT IN KNIGHTDALE, NORTH CAROLINA, AT 0945 HOURS.  

ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT OF RALEIGH HELICOPTERS, THE PILOT ARRIVED AT RALEIGH EAST AIRPORT AT 0800. THERE ARE NO RECORDS OF THE PILOT RECEIVING A WEATHER BRIEFING. ACCORDING TO WITNESSES AT THE AIRPORT, THE AIRPORT FOGGED IN WHEN THE PILOT ARRIVED. THE FLIGHT WAS DELAYED UNTIL VISUAL WEATHER CONDITIONS PREVAILED. ACCORDING TO WITNESSES AT THE AIRPORT, THE TAKEOFF AND INITIAL CLIMBOUT WERE NORMAL, BUT A MINUTE INTO THE DEPARTURE, THEY HEARD THE PILOT OF N83112 TRANSMIT IN AN EXCITED VOICE, ""HEY! I'VE GOT A.."". NO OTHER RADIO TRANSMISSIONS WERE HEARD.  

EYEWITNESSES, LOCATED 1/2 MILE EAST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, RECALLED SEEING THE HELICOPTER AS IT FLEW WEST AT AN ALTITUDE BETWEEN 200 AND 300 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. THEY STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER APPEARED TO ""FISHTAIL"", AND A SPUTTERING SOUND WAS ALSO HEARD COMING FROM THE HELICOPTER. THE WITNESSES CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THE HELICOPTER UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED INTO THE 80 FOOT TALL TREES; SECONDS LATER, A FIREBALL WAS SEEN RISING FROM THE AREA WHERE THE HELICOPTER WAS LAST SEEN.

PERSONNEL INFORMATION

INFORMATION ON THE PILOT IS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT AT THE DATA FIELD LABELED ""FIRST PILOT INFORMATION.""  THE 35 YEAR OLD, COMMERCIAL RATED PILOT WAS CERTIFICATED TO FLY SINGLE AND MULTIENGINE AIRPLANES, AND HELICOPTERS; HE WAS ALSO A CERTIFIED FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR (CFI) IN HELICOPTERS. ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT OF RALEIGH HELICOPTERS, THE PILOT WAS HIRED AS A PART-TIME FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR/PILOT ON APRIL 16, 1994. UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE PILOT FLEW AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND RECEIVED COMPENSATION FOR FLIGHT INSTRUCTION GIVEN TO STUDENTS FROM RALEIGH HELICOPTERS; THE PILOT WAS SEEKING ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT WHEN THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED.

A REVIEW OF THE PILOT'S FLIGHT LOGS REVEALED THAT, ON JULY 23, 1990, HE RECEIVED INITIAL HELICOPTER FLIGHT TRAINING FROM SOUTH CAROLINA HELICOPTERS, SALUDA, SOUTH CAROLINA, IN THE HUGHES 269A HELICOPTER.  ON JULY 31, 1990, THE PILOT RECEIVED A PRIVATE HELICOPTER RATING. THE FLIGHT LOG REVIEW ALSO SHOWED THAT THE PILOT COMPLETED AS MANY AS FOUR FLIGHTS IN ONE DAY AND HE FLEW A TOTAL OF 31.4 HOURS WITHIN SEVEN DAYS, TO COMPLETE HELICOPTER RATING REQUIREMENTS. 

SUBSEQUENT TO HIS INITIAL HELICOPTER QUALIFICATION, THE PILOT FLEW SEVERAL HOURS IN DIFFERENT AIRCRAFT, AND RECEIVED AN INITIAL CHECKOUT IN THE ROBINSON R-22 HELICOPTER FROM RALEIGH HELICOPTERS, KNIGHTDALE, NORTH CAROLINA ON DECEMBER 14, 1991. RECORDS INDICATED THE PILOT COMPLETED THE ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY (RHC) PILOT SAFETY CHECKOUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH RHC R-22 FLIGHT TRAINING GUIDE (SEE ATTACHED MANEUVERS LISTED IN THE RHC PILOT SAFETY CHECKOUT WORKSHEET). 

RALEIGH HELICOPTERS FLIGHT TRAINING PROGRAM IS OUTLINED IN THE FLIGHT TRAINING MANUAL. THE FLIGHT TRAINING MANUAL INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING AREAS:

          1. FLIGHT TRAINING SYLLABUS           2. GROUND TRAINING SYLLABUS           3. R-22 MANEUVER GUIDE           4. SCHOOL SAFETY  PROCEDURES           5. RHC SAFETY NOTICES (RSN-1 THROUGH 29)

THE OPERATOR ALSO REPORTED THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FLIGHT TRAINING GUIDE VARIED DUE TO THE PART-TIME STATUS OF MANY STUDENTS. OFTEN PART-TIME STUDENTS WOULD HAVE EXTENDED BREAKS IN THEIR TRAINING PROGRAM AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL REVIEW PERIODS TO RESTORE STUDENT PROFICIENCY BEFORE CONTINUING THE FLIGHT TRAINING PROGRAM. 

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

INFORMATION ON THE HELICOPTER IS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AT THE DATA FIELD LABELED ""AIRCRAFT INFORMATION.""  N83112 ARRIVED IN KNIGHTDALE AS A SALES AIRCRAFT. ON JULY 27, 1994, TRIANGLE HELICOPTER LEASING, LLC,  PURCHASED N83112 FROM THE ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY AND SUBSEQUENTLY LEASED THE HELICOPTER TO RALEIGH HELICOPTERS (SEE ATTACHED N83112 PURCHASE HISTORY). A REVIEW OF THE AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE RECORDS FAILED TO DISCLOSE ANY CARRYOVER OR DELAYED MAINTENANCE ACTIONS FOR THE POWERTRAIN OR FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEMS.

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

VISUAL WEATHER CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT THE ACCIDENT SITE AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. WEATHER INFORMATION IS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AT THE DATA FIELD LABELED ""WEATHER INFORMATION.""  WITNESSES AT THE AIRPORT AND WITHIN 1/2 MILE OF THE ACCIDENT SITE CONFIRMED THAT THE FOG LAYER HAD DISSIPATED WHEN THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED. APPROXIMATELY 18 MILES WEST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, INSTRUMENT WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE REPORTED AT THE RALEIGH-DURHAM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.   

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE MAIN WRECKAGE AND ACCIDENT SITE WERE LOCATED 1 1/2 MILES WEST OF RALEIGH EAST AIRPORT AND NORTH OF A SINGLE SET OF NORFOLK AND SOUTHERN RAILROAD TRACKS. EXAMINATION OF THE ACCIDENT SITE REVEALED THAT WRECKAGE DEBRIS FROM THE HELICOPTER WAS SCATTERED OVER AN AREA 800 FEET LONG AND 100 FEET WIDE. THE WRECKAGE DISTRIBUTION PATH WAS ORIENTATED ON A WESTERLY HEADING (SEE ATTACHED WRECKAGE DIAGRAM IN AIRWORTHINESS GROUP CHAIRMAN'S FACTUAL REPORT). 

A GENERAL EXAMINATION OF THE ACCIDENT SITE REVEALED THAT THE MAIN ROTOR ASSEMBLY AND THE AFT FIVE FOOT SECTION OF THE TAIL CONE, WITH TAIL ROTOR ASSEMBLY ATTACHED, WERE LOCATED WITHIN 125 FEET OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE. THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT WAS 600 FEET WEST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE. ALL HELICOPTER FLIGHT CONTROL COMPONENTS AND ACCESSORIES WERE RECOVERED FOR EXAMINATION. THE COCKPIT AND FUSELAGE WERE FIRE DAMAGED. DESPITE THE FIRE DAMAGE, FLIGHT AND POWERTRAIN CONTROL COMPONENTS WERE LOCATED IN THE WRECKAGE DEBRIS. PLEXIGLASS DEBRIS FROM THE WINDSHIELD AND SKYLIGHT WAS RECOVERED FROM THE WRECKAGE PATH 200 FEET EAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE. 

DURING THE RECONSTRUCTIVE PHASE, FLIGHT CONTROL ROD ENDS WERE LOCATED AND TRACED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE POSITIONS (SEE ATTACHED AIRFRAME AND SYSTEMS DAMAGE CHARTS). THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT AND A SECTION OF THE TAIL CONE WERE NOT RECOVERED INITIALLY, BUT A MONTH AFTER THE ACCIDENT, A LOCAL FAMILY FOUND THE DRIVE SHAFT IN THEIR BACKYARD; THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT WAS 600 FEET WEST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE. THE RECOVERED SECTION OF THE TAIL CONE WAS LOCATED 200 FEET EAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.

THE FIRE DAMAGED FUSELAGE SECTION OF THE AIRFRAME RESTED ON THE LEFT SIDE ORIENTATED ON A NORTHERLY MAGNETIC HEADING. THE POST IMPACT FIRE DESTROYED THE COCKPIT SECTION OF THE AIRFRAME AND THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT SUSTAINED EXTENSIVE THERMAL DAMAGE. FIRE ALSO MELTED PART OF THE RIGHT SKID ASSEMBLY AND PORTIONS OF THE FLIGHT CONTROL TUBES. ALTHOUGH THE TRANSMISSION AND MAST ASSEMBLIES WERE WITHIN THE FIRE PATTERN, THEY SUSTAINED LITTLE HEAT DISTRESS. 

FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE ACCIDENT SITE DISCLOSED THAT THE MAIN ROTOR ASSEMBLY SEPARATED FROM THE TRANSMISSION MAST JUST ABOVE THE SWASHPLATE ASSEMBLY. THE MAIN ROTOR ASSEMBLY, WITH BOTH BLADES ATTACHED, WAS LOCATED 31 FEET NORTH OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE. EXAMINATION OF MAIN ROTOR BLADE S/N 8262C SHOWED THAT THE BLADE WAS BENT GRADUALLY UPWARD OVER THE ENTIRE LENGTH EXCEPT FOR A SMALL AREA ON THE INBOARD SIDE OF A FRACTURE ON THE LEADING EDGE SPAR. THIS FRACTURE WAS 7 FEET 3 INCHES FROM THE TIP OF MAIN ROTOR BLADE S/N 8262C. ALL FRACTURES IN THE BLADE SKIN AND SPAR MATERIALS WERE TYPICAL OF OVERSTRESS SEPARATION.  MAIN ROTOR BLADE S/N 8246C ALSO EXHIBITED UPWARD BENDING OVER THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE BLADE SURFACE. FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE, S/N 8246C, REVEALED RED AND GRAY PAINT SMEARS ON THE UPPER SKIN AND ALONG THE LEADING EDGE (SEE ATTACHED AIRWORTHINESS GROUP CHAIRMAN'S REPORT). THE PAINT SMEARS WERE NINE FEET TWO INCHES FROM THE CENTER OF THE MAIN ROTOR HUB. 

AN ADDITIONAL EXAMINATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES INCLUDED THE  INSPECTION OF THE BONDING BETWEEN THE SKIN AND THE HONEYCOMB STRUCTURE. THIS EXAMINATION CHECKED SAMPLES FROM THE UNDAMAGED PORTION OF THE ROTOR BLADES. THE EXAMINATION SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF ADHESIVE SEPARATIONS, OR POOR WORKMANSHIP.

THE MAIN ROTOR HEAD SEPARATED FROM THE MAST ASSEMBLY JUST ABOVE THE SWASHPLATE ASSEMBLY. EXAMINATION OF THE FRACTURE FACE SHOWED THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED IN OVERLOAD. THERE WAS BUCKLING DAMAGE NEAR THE FRACTURE FACE ON THE MAST WHERE THE SPINDLE FROM BOTH BLADES MADE CONTACT. THE TUSK FOR THE SPINDLE FROM BLADE S/N 8262C WAS BROKEN IN OVERSTRESS SHEAR; THE TUSK FROM BLADE S/N 8246C REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE SPINDLE.

THE PAINT SMEARS ON THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES MATCHED THE PAINT SCHEME ON THE TAIL BOOM AND THE TAIL ROTOR PITCH CHANGE DRIVE TUBE. THE GRAY TAIL ROTOR PITCH CHANGE CONTROL TUBE WAS LOCATED ADJACENT TO THE RAILROAD BED NORTH OF THE TRACK NEAR THE MAIN WRECKAGE. THE FRACTURED END OF THE TAIL ROTOR PITCH CHANGE CONTROL TUBE WAS DIAGONALLY FLATTENED FROM THE NORMALLY ROUND SHAPE. 

AS PREVIOUSLY STATED, THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT WAS LOCATED 600 FEET WEST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE. EXAMINATION OF THE ASSEMBLY DISCLOSED THAT A SIMILAR DIAGONAL FLATTENING OF THE GRAY ROUND SHAFT OCCURRED AT THE MID-SPAN POINT. THE SHAFT WAS BENT AT THE MID-SPAN POINT IN EXCESS OF 90 DEGREES FROM ITS NORMALLY STRAIGHT CONDITION. THE RECOVERED SECTION OF THE TAIL CONE EXHIBITED DIAGONAL SLASH MARKS SIMILAR TO THE ONES OBSERVED ON THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT AND THE TAIL ROTOR PITCH CONTROL ROD. EXAMINATION OF THE RECOVERED PLEXIGLASS DEBRIS DISCLOSED NEAR VERTICAL SCRAPE MARKS ON SEVERAL PIECES. THE RECONSTRUCTIVE PROCESS OF THE PLEXIGLASS MATERIAL DETERMINED THAT THE MARKED PIECES WERE NORMALLY INSTALLED AT THE LEFT UPPER CORNER OF THE LEFT SEAT SIDE OF THE HELICOPTER.    

THE SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE ASSEMBLY FAILED TO DISCLOSE A MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION. THE ENGINE ASSEMBLY REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE AIRFRAME, AND RECEIVED SMOKE AND FIRE DAMAGE.  

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

THE POSTMORTEM EXAMINATION ON THE PILOT WAS PERFORMED BY DR. DEWEY H. PATE, AT THE NORTH CAROLINA OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER, CHAPEL HILL, NORTH CAROLINA. THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS REPORTED AS MULTIPLE TRAUMA SECONDARY TO THE ACCIDENT. THE TOXICOLOGY EXAMINATION WAS NEGATIVE FOR DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.  

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

RECOVERED AIRPORT SURVEILLANCE RADAR (SAR), RALEIGH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (RDU), DATA DISCLOSED THAT THE HELICOPTER HAD MADE A RIGHT-HAND TURN WITH THE GROUND TRACK CHANGING FROM A EASTERLY HEADING TO A WESTERLY HEADING. GROUND SPEED INFORMATION WAS NOT DETERMINED DURING THE 23 SECONDS OF RADAR COVERAGE. THE HELICOPTER MANEUVERED WITHIN AN AREA LESS THAN 1/5 OF A MILE SQUARE, 18 MILES EAST OF RDU AT 700 FEET MEAN SEA LEVEL. N83112 CHANGED FLIGHT DIRECTIONS FIVE TIMES BEFORE RADAR CONTACT WAS LOST AT 0947:00.440. 

A REVIEW OF RALEIGH HELICOPTERS' OPERATING PROCEDURES REVEALED THAT FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION'S (FAA) RECOMMENDATIONS FROM GENERAL AVIATION AIRWORTHINESS ALERT AC NO. 43-16, DATED JULY 22, 1994, WERE NOT INCORPORATED INTO THEIR NORMAL OPERATION. ACCORDING TO RALEIGH HELICOPTERS OFFICIALS, THIS ALERT WAS NEVER RECEIVED, AND THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS (SEE ATTACHED GENERAL AVIATION AIRWORTHINESS ALERT AC NO. 43-16). THE SPECIAL ISSUE, ROBINSON MODEL R-22 AND R-44 HELICOPTERS-RECENT ACCIDENTS PROVIDED SEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR R-22 AND R-44 OPERATIONS. THE SEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS STRESSED OPERATIONAL LIMITATIONS ON BOTH HELICOPTERS. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF SEVERAL R-22 AND R-44 AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS. 

ACCORDING TO THE BACKGROUND DATA, THE SPECIAL AIRWORTHINESS ALERT STATES THAT MANY OF THE R-22 ACCIDENTS OCCURRED WHEN THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES MADE CONTACT WITH THE FUSELAGE. MAST BUMPING OCCURRED BEFORE OR JUST AFTER THE CONTACT WAS  MADE. THE ALERT FURTHER STATED THAT MAST BUMPING MAY OCCUR WITH A TEETERING ROTOR SYSTEM WHEN EXCESSIVE MAIN ROTOR FLAPPING RESULTS FROM MAIN ROTOR BLADE STALL, LOW G (LOAD FACTOR BELOW 1.0), ABRUPT CONTROL INPUT, OR SOME COMBINATION OF THESE ELEMENTS. 

AN FAA OFFICIAL FROM THE CERTIFICATION OFFICE IN TEXAS STATED THAT THIS ALERT WAS MAILED TO ALL REGISTERED OPERATORS OF R-22 AND R-44 HELICOPTERS. ACCORDING TO THE OWNER OF N83112, THE LEASING COMPANY NEVER RECEIVED A COPY OF AC NO. 43-16, AND EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTY IN RECEIVING A COPY FROM THE FAA. DURING A CONVERSATION WITH AN OFFICIAL FROM ROBINSON HELICOPTER, ROBINSON HELICOPTER ALSO NEVER RECEIVED AC NO. 43-16, DATED JULY 22, 1994, FROM THE FAA.  

THE HELICOPTER WRECKAGE WAS RELEASED TO:

     GLEN BROWN  (PRESIDENT-RALEIGH HELICOPTERS)      HWY 64 EAST       KNIGHTDALE, NORTH CAROLINA","THE FLIGHT WAS DELAYED BECAUSE OF A FOG LAYER AT THE AIRPORT. ACCORDING TO WITNESSES AT THE AIRPORT, THE HELICOPTER DEPARTED WITHOUT INCIDENT. A MINUTE INTO THE FLIGHT THEY HEARD THE PILOT, ALSO A HELICOPTER CFI, SAY, 'HEY! I'VE GOT A...'. NO OTHER RADIO TRANSMISSIONS WERE HEARD. A WITNESS LOCATED NEAR THE ACCIDENT SITE RECALLED WATCHING THE HELICOPTER FISHTAIL, AND HEARD A SPUTTERING SOUND COMING FROM THE HELICOPTER. RADAR DATA DEPICTED THE HELICOPTER AT 700 FT MSL, FLYING IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION, AND THEN REVERSE COURSE TO A WESTERLY HEADING, WITHIN 23 SECS OF COVERAGE. THE MAIN FUSELAGE IMPACTED THE GROUND IN A WOODED AREA; OTHER DEBRIS FROM THE HELICOPTER WAS SCATTERED OVER AN AREA 800 FEET LONG AND 100 FEET WIDE. A POST IMPACT FIRE FURTHER DAMAGED THE AIRFRAME. EXAMINATION OF THE SEPARATED TAILCONE AND FUSELAGE COMPONENTS SHOWED EVIDENCE OF INFLIGHT MAIN ROTOR BLADE CONTACT; THE WRECKAGE EXAMINATION ALSO SHOWED SIGNS OF MAST BUMPING.",DIVERGENCE OF THE MAIN ROTOR FROM ITS NORMAL PLANE OF ROTATION FOR AN UNDETERMINED REASON(S) RESULTING IN ROTOR BLADE CONTACT WITH THE TAILCONE.

THE FAA REPORTED THAT ALL SERVICES PROVIDED TO N60TA BY THE VAN NUYS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER WERE NORMAL.  NO COMMUNICATIONS OCCURRED WITH THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER FOLLOWING ITS DEPARTURE FROM THE AIRPORT.  

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

FROM AN EXAMINATION OF THE ACCIDENT SITE AND HELICOPTER WRECKAGE, THE HELICOPTER WAS FOUND TO HAVE CRASHED INTO AN ESTIMATED 10-FOOT-HIGH DIRT EMBANKMENT WHICH WAS ADJACENT TO AN OPEN DIRT FIELD.  NO EVIDENCE OF SKID MARKS WAS OBSERVED IN THE FIELD ADJACENT TO THE MAIN WRECKAGE AREA.  

THE ACCIDENT SITE ELEVATION WAS ESTIMATED AT 1,080 FEET MEAN SEA LEVEL, AND AT GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES OF APPROXIMATELY 34 DEGREES 24.0 MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE, BY 118 DEGREES 40.0 MINUTES WEST LONGITUDE.  THIS LOCATION WAS ABOUT 14.4 NAUTICAL MILES AND 308 DEGREES (MAGNETIC) FROM THE VAN NUYS AIRPORT.

THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST PARTIALLY ON THE EMBANKMENT AND PARTIALLY IN THE OPEN FIELD (SEE PHOTOGRAPHS AND THE ACCIDENT SITE DIAGRAM).  THE HELICOPTER WAS FOUND GENERALLY POINTED IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION.  THE SKIDS WERE FOUND IN ABOUT A 90-DEGREE NOSE-DOWN PITCH ATTITUDE.  

THE ENTIRE COCKPIT WAS DESTROYED BY FIRE.  MOST OF THE CONTROL LINKAGES BETWEEN THE COCKPIT AND THE ROTOR BLADES, THE TRANSMISSION, THE MAST, AND PORTIONS OF THE ENGINE WERE OBSERVED DESTROYED BY FIRE.  THE PREIMPACT CONTINUITY OF THE FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM WAS NOT ESTABLISHED.  

SEVERAL COMPONENTS WERE FOUND IN THE OPEN FIELD AND WERE NOT FIRE DAMAGED.  FOR EXAMPLE, ONE MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS FOUND ABOUT 147 FEET WEST-NORTHWEST (303 DEGREES MAGNETIC) FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  THE TAIL ROTOR GEAR BOX, TAIL ROTOR, AND THE TAIL STINGER WERE FOUND BETWEEN 93 FEET AND 126 FEET WEST-NORTHWEST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS, INCLUDING THE EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTER (ELT), THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER, AND A TAIL ROTOR BLADE PITCH LINK WERE FOUND IN THE FIELD TO THE SOUTH AND WEST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE AT DISTANCES BETWEEN 5 AND 36 FEET.  THE LEFT REAR LANDING GEAR DAMPER WAS FOUND ON THE INCLINED SLOPE SEVERAL YARDS EAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.

THE MAIN TRANSMISSION AND THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX HOUSING WERE FOUND BROKEN OPEN.  THE MAIN TRANSMISSION HOUSING WAS OBSERVED PARTIALLY DESTROYED BY FIRE.  NO MAIN TRANSMISSION CHIP DETECTOR PLUG WAS LOCATED.  THE TAIL ROTOR GEAR BOX WAS FOUND IMPACT- DAMAGED. 

THE TAIL ROTOR GEAR BOX'S CHIP DETECTOR WAS REMOVED FROM THE GEARBOX, AND IT WAS EXAMINED.  NO METALLIC PARTICLES WERE FOUND.  A PINHEAD SIZE BALL OF BROWN DIRT-LIKE MATERIAL WAS OBSERVED ON THE DETECTOR.

CRUSHED AREAS IN THE SEPARATED TAIL ROTOR BLADE AND BLADE SPAR WERE FOUND TO MATCH THE CURVATURE OF THE LEADING EDGE OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE, WHICH WAS FOUND SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  (SEE PHOTOGRAPH AND THE INVESTIGATION REPORT SUBMITTED BY THE SCHWEIZER PARTICIPANT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OBSERVATIONS OF STRUCTURAL DEFORMATION, AND EVIDENCE OF MAIN ROTOR SPEED.)

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

AN AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED ON THE PILOT BY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY CORONERS OFFICE.  RESULTS OF TOXICOLOGY TESTS PERFORMED ON THE PILOT BY THE ARMED FORCES INSTITUTE OF PATHOLOGY WERE NEGATIVE FOR ETHANOL AND DRUGS.

1.   ENGINE.

     A.  VISUAL EXAMINATION.

THE ENGINE HAD SUSTAINED EXTENSIVE HEAT AND FIRE DAMAGE.  A HOLE, EXPOSING THE CAMSHAFT AND SEVERAL TAPPETS, WAS OBSERVED NEAR THE FRONT OF THE CASE.  A PORTION OF THE OIL SUMP AND THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ACCESSORY CASE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE FIRE.  ONE CYLINDER INTAKE PUSH ROD AND A TAPPET WERE LOCATED IN A PILE OF DEBRIS WHICH HAD BEEN RECOVERED FROM THE CRASH SITE.   

THE ENGINE WAS EQUIPPED WITH AN OVER SPEED GOVERNOR CONTROL (HARTZELL ANTI-OVER-SPEED KIT).  THE GOVERNOR WAS FOUND ATTACHED TO THE ENGINE.  THE GOVERNOR WAS REMOVED AND VISUALLY EXAMINED.  THE GOVERNOR HAD SUSTAINED HEAT DAMAGE AND COULD NOT BE TESTED.  THE DRIVE GEAR WAS FOUND INTACT.

THE ENGINE WAS EQUIPPED WITH A LIGHT WEIGHT STARTER.  ACCORDING TO THE SCHWEIZER AIRCRAFT PARTICIPANT, THE MANUFACTURER DID NOT AUTHORIZE INSTALLATION OF A LIGHT WEIGHT STARTER BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE STARTER HOUSING AND THE IMPELLER SHROUD.

     B. IGNITION SYSTEM.

THE LEFT MAGNETO WAS NOT FOUND ATTACHED TO THE ENGINE.  SEVERAL FIRE-DAMAGED COMPONENTS WERE FOUND IN A PILE OF ENGINE-RELATED DEBRIS.

THE RIGHT MAGNETO WAS FOUND ATTACHED TO THE ENGINE.  THE MAGNETO WAS REMOVED AND VISUALLY EXAMINED.  IT WAS FOUND HEAT DAMAGED AND COULD NOT BE FUNCTIONALLY TESTED.

ALL EIGHT SPARK PLUGS WERE FOUND ATTACHED TO THE ENGINE.  THE HARNESS ASSEMBLY WAS DESTROYED BY FIRE.  THE SPARK PLUGS WERE REMOVED AND VISUALLY EXAMINED.  THE LYCOMING ENGINE PARTICIPANT OPINED THAT ALL SPARK PLUGS EXHIBITED NORMAL APPEARING ELECTRODE WEAR.  

     C.  FUEL SYSTEM.

THE FUEL SERVO UNIT WAS FOUND ATTACHED TO THE ENGINE AND WAS OBSERVED HEAT DAMAGED.  THE VERNIER-TYPE MIXTURE CONTROL CABLE WAS FOUND ATTACHED AND WAS OBSERVED IN THE FULL RICH POSITION.  THE THROTTLE ARM LINKAGE WAS FOUND IN AN INTERMEDIATE POSITION.  THE THROTTLE CABLE AND THE OVER-SPEED GOVERNOR LINKAGE WERE DESTROYED AND NOT ATTACHED TO THE SERVO.  

THE FLOW DIVIDER ASSEMBLY WAS NOT FOUND ATTACHED TO THE SERVO.  IT WAS OBSERVED SAFETY WIRED TO THE SERVO UNIT, BUT HAD SUSTAINED HEAT DAMAGE AND HAD SEPARATED FROM THE SERVO UNIT.

     D.  LUBRICATION SYSTEM.

THE OIL FILTER ADAPTOR AND CANISTER WERE FOUND SEPARATED FROM THE ENGINE AND WERE HEAT DAMAGED.  THE CANISTER ASSEMBLY WAS CUT OPEN AND THE ELEMENT WAS VISUALLY EXAMINED.  THE ELEMENT HAD SUSTAINED HEAT DAMAGE.  NO METAL CONTAMINATION WAS OBSERVED.

THE OIL SUCTION SCREEN WAS REMOVED AND VISUALLY EXAMINED.  THE SCREEN EXHIBITED HEAT DAMAGE AND WAS MOSTLY DRY.  NO METAL CONTAMINATION WAS OBSERVED.

     E.  VALVE, GEAR TRAIN, CYLINDERS, AND CRANKCASE.

ACCORDING TO THE LYCOMING ENGINE PARTICIPANT, THE CONTINUITY OF THE VALVE AND GEAR TRAIN COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED BECAUSE","THE STUDENT FLEW TO THE ASSIGNED PRACTICE AREA, PERFORMED  UNDETERMINED MANEUVERS, AND CRASHED INTO A DIRT EMBANKMENT ADJACENT TO AN OPEN FIELD. THERE WERE NO WITNESSES. EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED A MAIN ROTOR BLADE (MRB) HAD SEVERED THE TAIL ROTOR ASSEMBLY PRIOR TO THE HELICOPTER COMING TO FINAL REST. THE MRB, THE TAIL ROTOR BLADE ASSEMBLY, THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER, AND THE TAIL STINGER WERE FOUND IN THE FIELD UP TO 147 FEET FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE. THE MRB WAS OBSERVED CONED UPWARD AT A 30-DEGREE ANGLE OVER THE OUTBOARD 5-FOOT-LONG PORTION OF ITS SPAN. NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND IN THE HEAVILY FIRE DAMAGED WRECKAGE OF PREIMPACT MECHANICAL OR STRUCTURAL FAILURE. STRUCTURAL DEFORMATION TO THE FRAME WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE HELICOPTER HAVING IMPACTED THE EMBANKMENT WHILE DESCENDING WITH FORWARD AIRSPEED. NO GROUND SCAR WAS OBSERVED IN THE SOFT DIRT SURROUNDING THE MAIN WRECKAGE. REVIEW OF THE STUDENT'S RECONSTRUCTED FLIGHT TRAINING RECORDS INDICATED THAT POSSIBLE TRAINING DEFICIENCIES EXISTED IN AREAS INCLUDING RESPONDING TO EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONS AND CROSSWIND TAKEOFFS AND LANDINGS.",THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE CLEARANCE FROM A DIRT EMBANKMENT WHILE PERFORMING AN UNDETERMINED MANEUVER.

ON DECEMBER 1, 1994, ABOUT 1007 CENTRAL STANDARD TIME, AN AGUSTA SPA A109A II, N1QF, OPERATED BY METRO AVIATION, INC., WAS DESTROYED WHEN IT COLLIDED WITH THE TERRAIN NEAR ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN. THE COMMERCIAL PILOT AND TWO PASSENGERS (MEDICAL EVACUATION CREW MEMBERS) WERE FATALLY INJURED.  THE 14 CFR PART 91 POSITIONING FLIGHT DEPARTED THE ST. JOSEPH HOSPITAL IN VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS ABOUT 1003, EN ROUTE TO HOWELL, MICHIGAN.  THE PURPOSE OF THE FLIGHT WAS TO PICK UP A PATIENT AT HOWELL, AND RETURN TO ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL. 

PRIOR TO THE MORNING OF THE ACCIDENT N1QF WAS DESIGNATED AS THE STANDBY HELICOPTER; HOWEVER, THE PRIMARY HELICOPTER WAS SCHEDULED FOR MAINTENANCE ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, THEREFORE ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT HAD TO BE MOVED FROM THE PRIMARY CRAFT TO N1QF.  BEFORE THE TRANSFER COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED, N1QF WAS REQUIRED TO PREPARE FOR DISPATCH ON THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT.  WHAT WAS LATER DESCRIBED BY A WITNESS AS A ""HASTY DISPATCH,"" NECESSITATED A HURRIED DEPARTURE TO ACCOMPLISH THE TRANSFER OF EQUIPMENT, COMPLETE A PREFLIGHT,AND OTHER ITEMS NECESSARY FOR A MEDICAL EVACUATION FLIGHT.  THE WITNESS TO THE DEPARTURE STATED THAT A COMPLETE PREFLIGHT WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE CREW; ALTHOUGH THIS WITNESS DID NOT ACTUALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WATCH THE ENTIRE PREPARATION.  THE WITNESS INDICATED THAT THE START OF THE ENGINES WAS ""NORMAL,"" WITH NO DELAY IN THE ENGINE START UP.  THE FLIGHT DEPARTED AT 1003.

AT 1005 N1QF CONTACTED THE ANN ARBOR, FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) CONTROL TOWER (ATCT), GIVING ITS POSITION AS ONE AND ONE HALF MILES EAST OF ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL AND REQUESTING LANDING PERMISSION STATING, IN PART, ""I'D LIKE TO PROCEED INBOUND.. SINGLE ENGINE LANDING, PLEASE.""  SIX SECONDS LATER THE FLIGHT WAS CLEARED INTO THE CLASS D SURFACE AREA.  SEVEN SECONDS LATER, N1QF RESPONDED STATING, ""AH, DISREGARD, I'M GOING DOWN AT THIS TIME.""  NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS TRANSMITTED, NOR WAS THE REASON FOR THE SINGLE ENGINE LANDING STATED.  THE PILOT DID NOT DECLARE AN EMERGENCY NOR DID HE REQUEST ASSISTANCE.

THE PILOT THEN CONTACTED THE DISPATCHER, AT ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL AND STATED THAT HE WAS GOING TO LAND, ""NORTH OF THE UNIVERSITY.""  THE DISPATCHER REQUESTED THE INFORMATION BE REPEATED AND THE PILOT DID SO.  THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF ANY NEED FOR ASSISTANCE, THE NATURE OF ANY EMERGENCY SITUATION, NOR WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OF DIFFICULTIES BEING EXPERIENCED BY THE FLIGHT.  TWENTY-SIX SECONDS AFTER THE PILOT'S REPEATING THE LOCATION TO THE DISPATCHER, HE MADE A FINAL TRANSMISSION, INDICATING A CRASH WAS IMMINENT.

EYEWITNESSES OBSERVED THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER DURING THE FINAL FEW SECONDS OF THE FLIGHT.  TWO WITNESSES STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS TRAILING SMOKE FROM THE AREA OF THE ENGINES.  ONE WITNESS INDICTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS MANEUVERING JUST PRIOR TO THE IMPACT AND THAT DURING THE FINAL DESCENT WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS ""DROPPED LIKE A STONE,"" IT APPEARED THE ROTOR BLADES WERE ""NOT TURNING HARDLY AT ALL.""  WITNESSES REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS NEARLY SILENT JUST PRIOR TO GROUND IMPACT AND THAT THERE WAS NO ENGINE NOISE AT ALL AFTER IMPACT.

OTHER DAMAGE

ONE SMALL TREE WAS DAMAGED DURING THE IMPACT WITH THE TERRAIN.

PERSONAL INFORMATION

THE PILOT WAS BORN MAY 27, 1952, AND WAS THE HOLDER OF A COMMERCIAL HELICOPTER CERTIFICATE NUMBER 2157108, WITH INSTRUMENT HELICOPTER PRIVILEGES.  AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT HE HAD 5,000 HOURS FLIGHT TIME, WITH 3,500 HOURS OF PILOT IN COMMAND TIME AND 300 HOURS IN THE MAKE AND MODEL OF HELICOPTER INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT.  HE HELD A SECOND CLASS MEDICAL CERTIFICATE ISSUED JUNE 9, 1994.  HIS MOST RECENT BIENNIAL FLIGHT REVIEW WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN AN AGUSTA A109 ON OCTOBER 23, 1994.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER WAS AN AGUSTA SPA A109A II, SERIAL NUMBER 7311, N1QF.  THE HELICOPTER WAS MAINTAINED ON AN APPROVED INSPECTION PROGRAM.  THE MOST RECENT INSPECTION OCCURRED ON JUNE 13, 1994, WITH A TOTAL TIME IN SERVICE OF 1,870 HOURS.  THE HELICOPTER HAD ACCUMULATED 57 HOURS SINCE THE INSPECTION, AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. THE HELICOPTER WAS LAST FUELED ON NOVEMBER 22, 1994.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED FLAT TERRAIN IN A COMMERCIAL AREA, ON A NORTHEAST HEADING.  GROUND SCARS AND EYEWITNESS REPORTS INDICATED THAT THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED IN A NEAR VERTICAL DIRECTION WITH LITTLE FORWARD MOTION.  THE LANDING GEAR WAS FOUND IN THE EXTENDED (GEAR DOWN) POSITION.  THE HELICOPTER WAS LYING ON ITS LEFT SIDE.  THE FUSELAGE WAS CRUSHED TO ABOUT ONE-HALF THE ORIGINAL HEIGHT.  THE TAIL BOOM WAS PARTIALLY SEPARATED FROM THE FUSELAGE FROM GROUND IMPACT AND IMPACT WITH A SMALL TREE.  THREE OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE INTACT WITH LITTLE BENDING.  THE TAIL ROTOR ASSEMBLY HAD IMPACT DAMAGE ONLY WITH NO ROTATIONAL DAMAGE EVIDENT.  THE MAIN ROTOR HEAD EXHIBITED MARKS AND DAMAGE CONSISTENT WITH BLADE CONING IMPACT.

THE ROTOR SYSTEM WAS INSPECTED DURING THE ON SCENE PHASE OF THE INVESTIGATION INCLUDING THE MAIN AND TAIL ROTORS, TRANSMISSION AND GEARBOX.  NO DISCREPANCIES WERE NOTED. 

BOTH ENGINES AND THE TRANSMISSION EXHIBITED LITTLE IMPACT DAMAGE AND WERE REMOVED FOR FURTHER STUDY.  DURING THE ON-SCENE INVESTIGATION BOTH ENGINES ROTATED AND THERE WAS CONTINUITY THROUGHOUT THE GEAR TRAIN.  NO DAMAGE WAS VISIBLE IN THE OUTPUT DRIVE SHAFTS ON EITHER ENGINE.  THE FUEL CONTROL POINTER ON THE NUMBER 1 ENGINE WAS AT 30 DEGREES WITH THE THROTTLE HANDLE AT IDLE.  THE FUEL CONTROL POINTER ON THE NUMBER 2 ENGINE WAS AT 85 DEGREES WITH THE THROTTLE HANDLE ABOUT MID-RANGE.  FUEL VACUUM CHECKS WERE DONE WITH ENGINE NUMBER 1 HAVING NO LEAKS AND ENGINE NUMBER 2 HAVING A LEAK TRACED TO THE FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY.

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

A POST MORTEM EXAMINATION OF THE PILOT WAS CONDUCTED BY THE WASHTENAW COUNTY (MICHIGAN) MEDICAL EXAMINER, ON DECEMBER 2, 1994.  NO CONTRIBUTING PRE-EXISTING PATHOLOGY WAS FOUND.

A TOXICOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF SPECIMENS FROM THE PILOT PROVED NEGATIVE FOR THOSE DRUGS SCREEN.

TESTS AND RESEARCH

FUEL SAMPLES FROM THE FUELING SOURCE WERE FOUND TO BE FREE OF WATER AND WITHIN LIMITS FOR JET-A1.

FUEL AND OIL SAMPLES FROM THE HELICOPTER WERE TESTED AT THE ALLISON LAB AND WERE FOUND TO BE WITHIN LIMITS FOR JET-A1 FUEL AND MIL-L-23699E OIL.

AN EXAMINATION OF LIGHT BULB FILAMENTS REVEALED STRETCHED FILAMENTS IN THE ""MASTER WARNING,"" ""MASTER CAUTION,"" ""ENGINE #1 LOW RPM,"" ""ENGINE #2 LOW RPM."" AND ""LOW ROTOR RPM"" PANELS.

BOTH ENGINES WERE TEST RUN AT ALLISON ON A PRODUCTION TEST STAND ON JANUARY 11, 1995.  NUMBER 1 ENGINE WAS FOUND TO BE WITHIN LIMITS.  NUMBER 2 ENGINE EXPERIENCED EXCESSIVE COMPRESSOR VIBRATION, THEREFORE, THE CONTROL COMPONENTS FROM THAT ENGINE WERE TESTED ON THE NUMBER 1 ENGINE WHICH HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY RUN.  THE ENGINE OPERATION DID NOT REACH THE LIMITS FALLING ABOUT 2% BELOW TOP LIMITS.

THE COMPRESSOR FOR ENGINE NUMBER 2 WAS DISASSEMBLED AND INSPECTED.  A VISUAL INSPECTION REVEALED UNUSUAL BALANCE MARKS.  THE ROTOR WAS CHECK BALANCED AND IT MEASURED AT 0.006 OZ-IN OF UNBALANCE.  THE LIMIT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 0.001 OZ-IN.  ALTHOUGH THE EXACT MODE OF UNBALANCE WAS NOT DETERMINED, EXPERIENCED SOURCES INDICATED THAT THE UNUSUAL MARKS COULD NOT BE ASSOCIATED WITH NORMAL OPERATION OF THE ENGINE; HOWEVER COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPACT ARTIFACT.

THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS (ORIGINALLY) FROM ENGINE NUMBER 2 WERE TESTED ON OCTOBER 11, 1995, AND THE FUEL CONTROL WAS FOUND TO FALL ABOUT 2% BELOW THE TOP LIMIT. THERE WAS NOTHING FOUND THAT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE ENGINE FROM OPERATING NORMALLY AT THE CRUISE SETTING.

THROUGHOUT THE ON-SCENE INVESTIGATION AND DURING THE TESTING OF COMPONENTS, NOTHING WAS FOUND TO INDICATE ANY REASON THAT AN ENGINE SHOULD STOP RUNNING INFLIGHT.  NOTHING WAS FOUND IN EITHER ENGINE TO INDICATE AN INDICATION NECESSITATING A NEED TO MANUALLY SHUT DOWN AN ENGINE INFLIGHT.  

ADDITIONAL DATA/INFORMATION

PARTIES TO THE INVESTIGATION WERE THE FAA FLIGHT STANDARDS DISTRICT OFFICE, BELLEVILLE, MICHIGAN; AGUSTA AEROSPACE CORPORATION, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA; ALLISON, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA; ALLIED SIGNAL AEROSPACE, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA; AND METRO AVIATION INC., SHREVEPORT, LOUISIANA.

THE HELICOPTER WRECKAGE WAS RELEASED TO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE OWNER ON DECEMBER 16, AND DECEMBER 22, 1994 AND JANUARY 9, 1996.","THE FLIGHT HAD BEEN AIRBORNE FOR TWO MINUTES WHEN THE PILOT REQUESTED LANDING PERMISSION STATING, IN PART, 'I'D LIKE TO PROCEED INBOUND...SINGLE ENGINE LANDING, PLEASE.' HE CANCELLED THIS REQUEST IMMEDIATELY AND REPORTED '...I'M GOING DOWN AT THIS TIME.' HE THEN CONTACTED THE DISPATCH WHERE HE HAD DEPARTED AND REPORTED THE POSITION OF HIS INTENDED LANDING. AFTER THIS RADIO CALL, 23 TO 25 SECONDS PASSED BEFORE HIS LAST COMMUNICATION INDICATING AN IMMINENT CRASH. WITNESSES REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS NEARLY SILENT JUST PRIOR TO GROUND IMPACT AND THAT THERE WAS NO ENGINE NOISE AT ALL AFTER IMPACT. SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT NEITHER ENGINE WAS OPERATING AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT; HOWEVER, NO MECHANICAL REASON FOR THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER OR NECESSITY FOR AN ENGINE SHUTDOWN BY THE PILOT WAS DETERMINED. DAMAGE TO THE ROTOR SYSTEM INDICATED THAT RPM WAS EXTREMELY LOW AT THE TIME OF IMPACT.","THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO OBTAIN/MAINTAIN A SUCCESSFUL AUTOROTATION.  FACTORS WERE: A LOSS OF ENGINE POWER OF ONE ENGINE FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS, AND THE PILOT'S SHUTDOWN OF THE WRONG ENGINE."

ON JULY 21, 1995, ABOUT 1227 HOURS HAWAIIAN STANDARD TIME, A MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 369D, N1090S, OPERATING UNDER CALL SIGN AIR 1 BY THE HONOLULU FIRE DEPARTMENT (HFD) AS A PUBLIC USE AIRCRAFT, WAS DESTROYED WHILE MANEUVERING NEAR HAUULA, ON THE ISLAND OF OAHU, HAWAII.  CHANGING METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS EXISTED DURING THIS TIME.  THE PILOT AND TWO PASSENGERS, WHO WERE SUSPENDED BENEATH THE HELICOPTER IN A RESCUE NET, RECEIVED FATAL INJURIES.  THE FLIGHT ORIGINATED ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT AS AN ON-GOING SEARCH FOR A LOST HIKER IN THE KOOLAU MOUNTAINS NEAR SACRED FALLS.  

THE PILOT HAD MADE TWO PRIOR INSERTIONS OF SEARCH AND RESCUE (SAR) PERSONNEL INTO THE GENERAL AREA OF THE SEARCH.  THEY REPELLED OUT OF THE HELICOPTER TO THE GROUND.  ON EACH OF THE TWO INSERTIONS AN OBSERVER WAS ONBOARD TO RETRIEVE THE ROPE.

THE FIRST TWO INSERTED SAR PERSONNEL WERE SUBSEQUENTLY RELOCATED SEPARATELY BY THE PILOT WITH AN OBSERVER ONBOARD TO A CAMPSITE WITH THE USE OF A BILLY PUGH HELICOPTER RESCUE NET.  ACCORDING TO AN HFD REPORT TO THE SAFETY BOARD, AFTER RETURNING TO THE STAGING AREA, A DECISION WAS MADE TO INSERT TWO HONOLULU POLICE DEPARTMENT (HPD) OFFICERS INTO THE SEARCH AREA AT ONE TIME USING THE BILLY PUGH NET.  THE REPORT STATED THAT THE DECISION WAS MADE BY THE PILOT TO FLY WITHOUT AN OBSERVER. 

ACCORDING TO AN HFD PILOT, WHEN OPERATING WITHOUT AN OBSERVER THE PILOT MUST LEAN OUTSIDE OF THE HELICOPTER TO MAINTAIN VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE NET.   

ACCORDING TO RESIDENT SEARCH PERSONNEL, CHANGING TRADE WINDS AND CLOUD COVER ARE A COMMON PHENOMENA IN THE AREA AND HAD BEEN AFFECTING THE SEARCH FOR 5 DAYS.  AFTER THE PILOT DEPARTED THE STAGING AREA WITH THE TWO HPD SEARCHERS IN THE NET, A PREVIOUSLY PLACED SEARCHER RADIOED THE PILOT OF AIR 1 THREE TIMES.  HE ADVISED THE PILOT, ""PETE, IT'S JUST TOO SOUPY UP HERE, YOUR GONNA HAVE TO TAKE EM BACK DOWN.  I CANT EVEN SEE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER.""  A REVIEW OF THE RECORDED VOICE COMMUNICATIONS REVEALED THAT THERE WAS NO VERBAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM THE PILOT.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER, A SEARCHER HEARD A CRASH OR IMPACT SOUND FOLLOWED BRIEFLY BY A SOUND OF THE HELICOPTER ENGINE NOISE SPOOLING UP THEN DOWN AND THEN SILENCE. 

TWO PEOPLE WERE HIKING TOGETHER IN THE SACRED FALLS AREA AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.  THEY WERE BOTH INTERVIEWED BY TELEPHONE. BOTH HIKERS OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER IN-FLIGHT WITH THE NET ATTACHED; HOWEVER, THEY COULD NOT POSITIVELY IDENTIFY WHAT WAS IN THE NET.  THE TIME FRAME OF BETWEEN 1225 AND 1230 WAS ESTABLISHED BY THEIR NEED TO START HIKING BACK OUT OF THE CANYON BY A CERTAIN TIME.  

THE FIRST HIKER TO BE INTERVIEWED STATED THAT SHE OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER TURNING SLOWLY AND DESCENDING WITH THE NET SWINGING BACK AND FORTH LIKE A PENDULUM.  SHE ESTIMATED THE AMOUNT OF SWING TO BE ABOUT 20 TO 30 DEGREES.  SHE ALSO NOTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS CLOSE TO THE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN AND THE WEATHER WAS CLOUDY WITH INTERMITTENT LIGHT RAIN.  

THE SECOND HIKER ALSO OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER TURNING SLOWLY, BUT NOTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS PARTIALLY IN THE CLOUDS WHICH WERE BOILING AROUND THE HELICOPTER.  HE STATED THAT THE NET WAS IN THE CLEAR, BUT SWINGING BACK AND FORTH AN ESTIMATED 45 TO 50 DEGREES LIKE A PENDULUM.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT THE HELICOPTER APPEARED TO BE CLOSE TO THE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN.

PILOT INFORMATION

THE PILOT WAS EMPLOYED BY THE HFD ON MARCH 1, 1991, AS A FIRE FIGHTER. ON OCTOBER 13, 1994, THE PILOT MET ALL THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR FLYING AS A RELIEF PILOT.  THE PILOT WAS SELECTED FOR RELIEF PILOT TRAINING ON JANUARY 13, 1994.  THE HFD DOES NOT HAVE A RELIEF PILOT POSITION.  ONCE THE FIREFIGHTER IS QUALIFIED TO BE A RELIEF PILOT, HE CONTINUES IN HIS REGULAR POSITION AS A FIREFIGHTER AND IS TEMPORARILY ASSIGNED TO A PILOT'S POSITION IN THE EVENT OF AN ABSENCE OF THE REGULAR PILOT.

AT THE TIME OF THE REQUEST, HE REPORTED A TOTAL OF 1,990 FIXED WING HOURS AND 321 HELICOPTER HOURS, FOR A COMBINED TOTAL FLIGHT TIME OF 2,311 HOURS.  EXAMINATION OF ALL AVAILABLE RECORDS DISCLOSED DIFFERENCES IN THE PILOT'S FLIGHT EXPERIENCE AS ENTERED IN THE VARIOUS DOCUMENTS.

THE PILOT REPORTED A TOTAL FLIGHT TIME OF 3,400 HOURS WITH 200 IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS ON HIS LAST CLASS TWO FLIGHT PHYSICAL, DATED JUNE 8, 1995.

ACCORDING TO HELICOPTER FLIGHT SCHOOL RECORDS, THE PILOT STARTED HELICOPTER FLIGHT TRAINING ON SEPTEMBER 11, 1992, AT BURBANK, CALIFORNIA.  THE OPERATOR PROVIDED A BELL 47-D1, WITH A FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR. 

ACCORDING TO THE OPERATOR AND FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR RECORDS, THE PILOT FLEW FROM SEPTEMBER 11, 1992, THROUGH OCTOBER 9, 1992, DURING WHICH TIME HE RECEIVED HIS PRIVATE, COMMERCIAL, AND CFI ADD-ON RATINGS.  THE INSTRUCTOR STATED THAT HE FLEW 34.8 HOURS OF DUAL FLIGHT INSTRUCTION WITH THE PILOT.  THE INSTRUCTOR ALSO STATED THAT THE PILOT FLEW AN ADDITIONAL 17 HOURS OF SOLO WHILE PREPARING FOR HIS ADD-ON RATINGS.  THE PILOT'S LAST ADD-ON RATING WAS FOR FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR ROTORCRAFT HELICOPTER ON OCTOBER 9, 1992.  AT THAT TIME, HE REPORTED 57 TOTAL HELICOPTER FLIGHT HOURS, WITH 22 HOURS OF DUAL INSTRUCTION AND 38 HOURS OF SOLO FLIGHT.  THE PILOT'S LOG BOOK DOCUMENTS 22.8 HOURS OF DUAL AND 39.4 HOURS OF SOLO FLIGHT IN THE BELL 47-D1 HELICOPTER.

ACCORDING TO THE PILOT'S LOG BOOK, ON FEBRUARY 13, 1993, THE PILOT TOOK HIS FIRST DUAL FLIGHT INSTRUCTION IN AN HFD HELICOPTER.  ACCORDING TO HFD RECORDS, AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT THE PILOT HAD ACCUMULATED A TOTAL OF 222.2 HOURS IN THE HFD HELICOPTER; 50.3 OF THESE HOURS WERE DUAL INSTRUCTION.  THE LAST DOCUMENTED DUAL INSTRUCTION WAS OCTOBER 13, 1994, AND CONSISTED OF HIS RELIEF PILOT CHECKOUT FLIGHT AND A BIENNIAL FLIGHT REVIEW.

ACCORDING TO A PILOT HISTORY FORM PROVIDED BY THE PILOT TO HFD, AS OF JUNE 20, 1995, THE PILOT REPORTED 3,011 TOTAL FLIGHT HOURS. OF THAT, 511 HOURS WERE HELICOPTER FLIGHT HOURS WITH ABOUT 200 HOURS IN A MD369D.  IN THE LAST 90 DAYS HE LISTED 3 HOURS OF     MD369D HELICOPTER FLIGHT TIME.  A REVIEW OF THE PILOT'S ACTUAL FLIGHT LOGS REVEALED THAT THEY WERE SPORADICALLY DATED WITH INCOMPLETE ENTRIES AND NO PAGE TOTALS.

AN INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE HFD CHIEF PILOT.  THE CHIEF PILOT STATED THAT THEIR WERE NO WRITTEN TRAINING RECORDS, WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS, OR DUAL FLIGHT INSTRUCTION FORMATS GIVEN THE  ACCIDENT PILOT. 

AN EXAMINATION OF THE MISSION LOG BOOK REVEALED THAT THE ACCIDENT PILOT RESPONDED TO ABOUT 33 ALARMS AS A SOLO PILOT.  DURING THE 33 ALARMS, THE PILOT PERFORMED ABOUT 10 RESCUES, WITH ABOUT NINE WATER OR NET OPERATIONS, AND THREE REPELLINGS.

THE CHIEF PILOT WAS ASKED IF THEIR WAS ANY EVIDENCE OF AN EMERGENCY BRIEFING OF THE HPD NET PASSENGERS PRIOR TO THE LAST FLIGHT.  HE STATED THAT THERE WAS NO BRIEFING.  HE WAS THEN ASKED IF THERE WOULD HAVE ROUTINELY BEEN A BRIEFING OF PASSENGERS PRIOR TO FLIGHT.  HE STATED NO BECAUSE THEY ROUTINELY WORK WITH THEIR OWN PERSONNEL WHO ARE TRAINED BY THE HFD.  

HELICOPTER INFORMATION

THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WAS OPERATING AS AIR 1.  TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE TWO HELICOPTERS ON THE GROUND FOR MAINTENANCE PURPOSES OR GENERAL REFERENCE, THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WAS ACTUALLY KNOWN AS AIR 2.  WHICHEVER HELICOPTER WAS AIRBORNE, FOR COMMUNICATION PURPOSES, THE HELICOPTER WAS CALLED AIR 1.  IF THE SECOND HELICOPTER WAS CALLED OUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT WAS CALLED AIR 2.

THE MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 369D HELICOPTER WAS MANUFACTURED AS A 1980 MODEL.  ACCORDING TO THE MAINTENANCE RECORDS, AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT THE HELICOPTER HAD ACCUMULATED 6,592.6 HOURS OF OPERATION.  THE HELICOPTER WAS MAINTAINED UNDER A MAINTENANCE PROGRAM PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER, MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, AS A 100, 200, AND 300-HOUR INSPECTION PROGRAM.  A REVIEW OF THE RECORDS REVEALED NO OUTSTANDING MAINTENANCE ITEMS.    

DURING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ACCIDENT PILOT'S WIFE, SHE STATED THAT HER HUSBAND HAD TOLD HER THAT BOTH HELICOPTERS HAD VIBRATIONS.  SHE STATED THAT AIR 2 HAD AN OVERTEMP PROBLEM SOME TIME AROUND JULY 1, 1995.  SHE STATED THAT HER HUSBAND SAID SEVERAL ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO FIX THE PROBLEM, BUT HE FINALLY FIXED IT HIMSELF.  

A REVIEW OF THE DISCREPANCY SHEET REVEALED THAT ON JULY 13,1995, THE ENGINE WAS REPORTED TO BE RUNNING HOT.  THE ENGINE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REPLACED ALONG WITH A TURBINE OUTLET TEMPERATURE  GAUGE, AND A GASKET WAS INSTALLED TO SEAL UP THE HEATER PLATE IN THE SCAVENGE AIR SYSTEM.

THE HFD PERSONNEL WERE QUESTIONED REGARDING HIGH OR              OVER TEMPERATURE PROBLEMS RELATING TO THE ACCIDENT PILOT.  THEY REPORTED THAT THE PILOT HAD OVERTEMPED (OPERATIONAL EXCEEDENCE) BOTH HELICOPTERS.  ON FEBRUARY 26, 1995, THE PILOT HAD A START TEMPERATURE EXCEEDENCE (HOT START) IN HELICOPTER N58388.  ON MARCH 9, 1995, THE PILOT EXPERIENCED AN OPERATIONAL TEMPERATURE EXCEEDENCE IN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER.  THE ENGINES WERE INSPECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ALLISON 250-C20 SERIES OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE MANUAL TABLE III-8, SPECIAL INSPECTIONS. 

THE HELICOPTER RESCUE NET IS MANUFACTURED UNDER AN FAA SUPPLEMENTAL TYPE CERTIFICATE (STC) AND IS DESIGNED FOR TWO 180-POUND PERSONS.  THERE ARE NO OPERATING LIMITATIONS PROVIDED WITH THE STC.  ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER, THE NET WAS DESIGNED FOR RESCUE RECOVERY; HOWEVER, IT CAN ALSO BE USED FOR PERSONNEL TRANSFER.  THE NET IS CARRIED BY ONE 9/16-INCH BY 50-FOOT 8-STRAND PLIMOOR COLUMBIAN ROPE.  THE MAXIMUM YIELD STRENGTH IS 9,000 POUNDS.  THE ROPE HOOKS TO THE HELICOPTER FROM THE CENTER OF THE BELLY BY TWO SOLENOID OPERATED HOOKS/LATCHES. THE SINGLE ROPE IS HOOKED TO EACH HOOK BY A SEPARATE CARABINEER. EXCEPT FOR A WATER BUCKET OPERATION, POWER TO THE HOOKS IS DISCONNECTED BY PULLING THE CIRCUIT BREAKERS AND DISARMING THE SWITCH TO PREVENT INADVERTENT RELEASE OF THE LOAD.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS LOCATED IN THE KOOLAU MOUNTAIN RANGE AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT 2,000 FEET MSL.  THE TERRAIN SLOPE WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 60 TO 70 DEGREES.  THE WRECKAGE WAS CO-MINGLED WITH A DENSE FOLIAGE GROWTH AVERAGING ABOUT 6 FEET DEEP. 

POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE STARTED DURING THE  HELICOPTER SLING LOAD RETRIEVAL PROCESS.  THE LEFT SKID WAS INADVERTENTLY DROPPED INTO A CANYON DURING THE SLING LOAD OPERATION AND NOT RECOVERED.  

THE BILLY PUGH HELICOPTER RESCUE NET THAT HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE TWO HPD OFFICERS WAS FOUND ABOUT 150 FEET UPSLOPE FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  THE LIFT ROPE ATTACH POINTS FOR THE NET WERE MISSING.  THE RECTANGULAR TUBE FRAME WAS BENT DOWN IN THE FRONT ABOUT 9 INCHES.  THE LEAD WEIGHT DROGUE CHUTE RING WAS FOUND BENT OVER 180 DEGREES AND STILL ATTACHED TO THE RESCUE NET BY IT'S ROPE.      

THE NET ROPE WAS FOUND WRAPPED AROUND THE ROTOR MAST AT THE RUBBER BOOT.  EXAMINATION OF THE ROPE REVEALED PAINT TRANSFERS OF DIFFERENT COLORS SIMILAR TO THE CODED PITCH CHANGE AND ROTOR BLADE COMPONENT COLORS.  THE ROPE WAS REMOVED AND MEASURED.  THE RECOVERED ROPE WAS MEASURED TO BE 44-FEET 8-INCHES IN LENGTH.  ACCORDING TO AN HFD PILOT, THE ROPE BEING USED WAS 50 FEET IN LENGTH.

THE RED CODED MAIN ROTOR BLADE SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM AND HAD APPROXIMATELY A 140-DEGREE DOWNWARD BEND, ABOUT 28 INCHES OUTBOARD OF THE BLADE ROOT END.  THE ABRASION STRIP EVIDENCED A MATERIAL TRANSFER OF FIBERGLASS FROM AN UNKNOWN SOURCE.  THE UPPER AND LOWER TRAILING EDGES OF THE BLADE WERE SPREAD OPEN FROM THE BLADE TIP INBOARD APPROXIMATELY 89 INCHES, AND HAD ROPE MARKS ON THE BLADE BOTTOM AND INSIDE OF THE UPPER TRAILING EDGE.  THE BLADE HAD NEGLIGIBLE LEADING EDGE DAMAGE AND THE TIP WEIGHT WAS INTACT.

THE GREEN CODED MAIN ROTOR BLADE SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM AND HAD APPROXIMATELY A 30-DEGREE BEND REARWARD AT MIDSPAN WITH NO LEADING EDGE DAMAGE.  THE PITCH CASE REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE BLADE AND HAD A FRACTURE OF THE TOP SIDE.  THE FORWARD LEADING EDGE LEAD/LAG PIN WAS FOUND MISSING.  IMPACT DAMAGE WAS FOUND NEAR THE PINS NORMAL POSITION.  THE BLADE EXHIBITED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE, BUT WAS INTACT FOR THE FULL LENGTH.  THE BLADE TIP WEIGHT WAS INTACT.

THE YELLOW MAIN ROTOR BLADE SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN ROTOR HUB ASSEMBLY.  THE OUTBOARD 54 INCHES HAD AN OVERLOAD FRACTURE AND SEPARATION IN THE FORM OF DOWNWARD BENDING.  THERE WAS NO LEADING EDGE DAMAGE ON THE OUTBOARD 54-INCH SECTION OF THE BLADE.  THE BLADE TIP WEIGHT WAS INTACT. 

THE BLUE CODED MAIN ROTOR BLADE SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM AND HAD APPROXIMATELY A 4-FOOT INBOARD-TO-OUTBOARD TEAR IN THE TOP SIDE BLADE SKIN, WITH CORRESPONDING AIRFRAME YELLOW PAINT TRANSFER FOR THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE TEAR.  THE BLUE BLADE ALSO HAD AN APPROXIMATE 64-DEGREE DOWNWARD BEND OF THE OUTBOARD 2 FEET.  THE BLADE HAD LEADING EDGE INDENTATIONS ON THE OUTBOARD 3 FEET OF THE BLADE.  THE PITCH CASE AND BLADE ROOT WERE SEPARATED FROM THE BLADE AND NOT RECOVERED.

THE WHITE CODED MAIN ROTOR BLADE PITCH CASE AND APPROXIMATELY 1 FOOT OF THE BLADE ROOT END REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE MAIN ROTOR HUB.  AN APPROXIMATE 50-INCH SECTION OF THE INBOARD WHITE MAIN ROTOR BLADE LEADING EDGE SPAR WAS WRAPPED AROUND THE MAIN ROTOR MAST.  THE MAIN ROTOR STRAP ASSEMBLY HAD BUCKLING AND STRETCHING, BUT NO COMPLETE FRACTURE OF THE LAMINATES.  THE BLADE EXHIBITED LEADING EDGE DAMAGE ON THE OUTBOARD SECTION OF THE BLADE, AS WELL AS BLACK PAINT TRANSFER ON THE TOP SIDE OF THE LEADING EDGE ABRASION STRIP.  ORANGE COLOR MATERIAL SIMILAR TO THE NET NYLON ROPE SUPPORT STRUCTURE WAS PRESENT IN THE LEADING EDGE INDENTATIONS. 

FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE NORTHWARD ABOUT 250 FEET AND SEPARATED BY A RAVINE, THE MAJORITY OF THE TAIL BOOM ASSEMBLY WAS FOUND WITH ALL COMPONENTS STILL ATTACHED.  THE TAIL ROTOR BLADES WERE DAMAGED.   

EXAMINATION OF THE LONGITUDINAL AND THE LATERAL TRIM ACTUATORS REVEALED THAT BOTH HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY IMPACT FORCES.  THE TRIM SWITCH WAS DESTROYED BY THE POSTCRASH FIRE DAMAGE.

EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED: SEVERE FOREIGN OBJECT DAMAGE (FOD) OF THE FIRST STAGE BLADES AND INLET GUIDE VANES; MINOR FOD WAS FOUND ON STAGE TWO AND THREE BLADES; METAL PARTICLES WERE FOUND IN THE COMBUSTION AREA; ALUMINUM DEPOSITS WERE PRESENT ON THE NOZZLE SHIELD OF THE FIRST STAGE; THE NO. 1 AND NO. 2 SHAFTS WERE FOUND INTACT; THE COMBUSTION LINER WAS INTACT; MODERATE CARBONING OF THE FUEL NOZZLES WERE NOTED; AND THERE WAS NO DISTRESS NOTED IN THE GEARS AND THE BEARINGS OF THE GEAR BOX.   

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

THE CLOSEST OFFICIAL WEATHER REPORTING FACILITY IS LOCATED ABOUT 20 MILES AWAY.

A HPD HELICOPTER PILOT ARRIVED IN THE AREA ABOUT 45 MINUTES AFTER THE ACCIDENT.  HE REPORTED: THE CEILING WAS 3,500-FOOT OVERCAST; VISIBILITY INTO THE VALLEY ABOVE 2,000 FEET MSL WAS LESS THAN 2/5 OF A MILE IN INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS; WINDS AT 1,840 FEET MSL WERE 20 TO 25 KNOTS OVER AN ARC OF 030 TO 060 DEGREES; AND THE CLOUDS WERE DRIFTING IN AND OUT OF THE VALLEY WITH APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 15 MINUTE INTERVALS.  WHILE FLYING OVER THE CRASH SITE SEARCHING FOR SURVIVORS, HE EXPERIENCED SWIRLING WINDS IN AND ABOVE A WATERFALL, WITH UP AND DOWN DRAFTS COMING OVER THE RIDGES AND FINGERS OF THE IMMEDIATE AREA.  THE WITNESS PILOT REPORTED THAT WHILE TRYING TO HOVER OVER THE CRASH SITE, HE HAD EXPERIENCED CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO SETTLING WITH POWER ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.

THERE WAS AN ADVISORY TO AIRMEN (AIRMET) IN EFFECT FOR MODERATE TURBULENCE BELOW 6,000 FEET MSL.

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

ON JULY 23, 1995, THE HONOLULU COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER PERFORMED AN AUTOPSY ON THE PILOT.  THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS ATTRIBUTED TO MULTIPLE BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE AUTOPSY, NO PREEXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS WERE NOTED THAT WOULD HAVE AFFECTED THE PILOT'S ABILITY TO PILOT AN AIRCRAFT.

DURING THE AUTOPSY, SAMPLES WERE OBTAINED FOR TOXICOLOGICAL ANALYSIS BY THE FAA CIVIL AEROMEDICAL INSTITUTE IN OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA.  THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS WAS NEGATIVE FOR DRUGS AND ETHANOL.

TESTING AND RESEARCH INFORMATION

ON JULY 23, 1995, A POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE RECOVERED HELICOPTER STRUCTURE, SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, AND ENGINE WAS  STARTED.  THE TOTAL CONTROL CONTINUITY WAS NOT ESTABLISHED DUE TO THE FIRE DAMAGE.

THE GREEN CODED MAIN ROTOR BLADE ATTACHING PIN WAS NOT RECOVERED. A SERVICE DIFFICULTY (SDR) REPORT SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED.  THERE WERE SEVEN SDR REPORTS OF ATTACHING PIN BUSHING, CRACKING, OR SAFETY LATCH PROBLEMS, BUT THERE WERE NO REPORTED PIN LOSSES DURING FLI","THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HELICOPTER PILOT WAS FLYING WITHOUT AN OBSERVER. HE WAS INSERTING TWO POLICE OFFICERS WHO WERE IN A RESCUE NET 50 FEET BELOW THE HELICOPTER, INTO MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN TO SEARCH FOR A MISSING HIKER. DETERIORATING WEATHER AND CLOUD COVER WITH TURBULENCE WAS PRESENT. GROUND PERSONNEL WARNED THE PILOT THREE TIMES OF THE DETERIORATING CONDITIONS. A WITNESS STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS PARTIALLY IN THE CLOUDS BUT THE NET WAS IN THE CLEAR. HIKERS IN A CANYON NEAR THE ACCIDENT SITE OBSERVED THE NET SWINGING LIKE A PENDULUM THROUGH AN ARC OF 45 TO 50 DEGREES. EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED THAT THE LINE WHICH SECURED THE NET TO THE HELICOPTER BECAME ENTANGLED WITH THE MAIN ROTOR AND WAS FOUND WRAPPED AROUND THE MAIN ROTOR MAST AND ALL THE MAIN ROTOR PITCH CHANGE LINKS WERE FACTURED. THE HELICOPTER PILOT'S FIRE DEPARTMENT RECORDS INDICATED HE HAD 511 HOURS OF HELICOPTER TIME WITH 2500 HOURS OF FIXED WING TIME. RECORDS WERE RECOVERED TO DOCUMENT ABOUT 261 HOURS OF ACTUAL HELICOPTER TIME. THE PILOT HAD RECEIVED ABOUT 50 HOURS OF DUAL INSTRUCTION FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CHIEF PILOT IN THEIR TYPE OF OPERATIONS.",THE PILOT'S POOR JUDGEMENT BY INTENTIONALLY FLYING INTO ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS IN MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN WITH AN EXTERNAL LOAD AND NO OBSERVER WHICH RESULTED IN LOSS OF AIRCRAFT CONTROL.  FACTORS WERE PRESSURE FROM THE CONDITIONS/EVENTS AND A LACK OF TOTAL EXPERIENCE IN THE TYPE OF OPERATION.

ON DECEMBER 5, 1995, AT 1201 CENTRAL STANDARD TIME, A MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 369E, N16089, COLLIDED WITH POWER LINES AND A POLE WHILE HOVERING OUT OF GROUND (OGE) EFFECT NEAR THIBODAUX, LOUISIANA.  THE COMMERCIAL PILOT RECEIVED MINOR INJURIES AND THE OTHER CREWMEMBER (AIRBORNE WORKMAN) SUSTAINED FATAL INJURIES.  HAVERFIELD CORPORATION OF MIAMI, FLORIDA, WAS OPERATING THE HELICOPTER UNDER A TITLE 14 CFR PART 133 OPERATING CERTIFICATE AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.  THE FLIGHT HAD BEEN WORKING ON THE AREA POWER LINE SINCE ABOUT 0730.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED FOR THE LOCAL FLIGHT AND A COMPANY (VFR) FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED.   

DURING A PERSONAL INTERVIEW, CONDUCTED BY THE INVESTIGATOR-IN-CHARGE, THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER STAGING AREA WAS LOCATED ABOUT ONE MILE FROM THE POWER LINE AND, AFTER REFUELING, THE FLIGHT HAD BEEN AIRBORNE ABOUT 45 MINUTES BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.  THE HELICOPTER WAS HOVERING STATIONARY AND PARALLEL TO THE POWER LINES, ABOUT 55 FEET AGL, IN AN EAST SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION WITH WINDS FROM THE SOUTHWEST (200 TO 210 DEGREES) AT 5 KNOTS OR HIGHER (10 KNOTS).  THE CREW MEMBER, HELD BY A SAFETY HARNESS, WAS WORKING FROM THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PLATFORM AND WAS INSTALLING A SHIELD WIRE (OVERHEAD GROUND WIRE) IN ROLLER BLOCKS.  WHILE HOVERING THE HELICOPTER WITH THE LEFT SIDE OF THE WORK PLATFORM ABOUT 4 INCHES FROM THE SHIELD WIRE, THE ""CYCLIC SUDDENLY MOVED TO THE LEFT AND MAYBE SLIGHTLY FORWARD.""  THE AIRCRAFT ""IMMEDIATELY STARTED MOVING TO THE LEFT INTO THE POLE AND LINE.""  THE PILOT STATED THAT HE WAS ""TRYING TO STOP THE CYCLIC"" AND MOVE IT TO THE RIGHT; HOWEVER, ""CYCLIC MOVEMENT TO THE RIGHT HAD A RESTRICTION"" AND THE ""HELICOPTER STRUCK THE POLE AND/OR THE SHIELD WIRE, PIVOTED TO THE LEFT AND UP, OVER THE SHIELD WIRE.""  THE HELICOPTER ""BEGAN TO SPIN,"" THEN IMPACTED THE GROUND ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE LINES, AND CAME TO REST INVERTED.  A POST IMPACT FIRE ERUPTED.  THE PILOT, WHO WAS WEARING A NOMEX FLIGHT SUIT AND A HELMET, ESCAPED THE FIRE.  THE PILOT AND WITNESSES ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE THE CREWMEMBER TRAPPED UNDER THE PLATFORM; HOWEVER, THE HEAT FROM THE SPILLED FUEL FIRE PREVENTED THE RECOVERY.   

THE PILOT FURTHER STATED THAT HE HAD FLOWN THIS AIRCRAFT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AND HAD ""NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE CYCLIC TRIM OR FLIGHT CONTROLS.""  HE HAD BEEN WORKING THROUGHOUT THE MORNING ""WITHOUT A PROBLEM"" AND DID NOT RECALL ANY ""UNUSUAL VIBRATION, FEEDBACK, OR AIRCRAFT NOISE PRIOR TO THE CYCLIC MOVEMENT.""   HE WAS AWARE OF THE CONTROL INPUT DURING A NON COMMANDED TRIM AND STATED THAT THE CYCLIC MOVEMENT DURING THE IMPACT SEQUENCE WAS ""NOT THE TRIM.""

WITNESSES AND A LOCAL FIREFIGHTER REPORTED OBSERVING THE HELICOPTER HOVERING STATIONARY AND PARALLEL TO THE POWER LINES WITH THE HELICOPTER FACING TO THE EAST.  THEY REPORTED THE WINDS WERE FROM THE SOUTH SOUTHWEST AT 15 KNOTS WITH ""OCCASIONAL GUST.""  ONE WITNESS WHO OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER HOVERING NEAR THE ELECTRICAL POST, REPORTED THAT ""THE HELICOPTER SOUND CHANGED AND I SAW THE HELICOPTER'S TAIL RISE, [AND] THE NOSE ROLL TO THE LEFT.""

PERSONNEL INFORMATION:

COMPANY PERSONNEL REPORTED THAT THE PILOT HAD WORKED AT THE THIBODAUX SITE SINCE SEPTEMBER 1995.  HAVERFIELD CORPORATION CONTRACTED TO ENTERGY SERVICES, INC., OF NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, FOR THE HELICOPTER CREW TO ASSIST A GROUND CONTRACTOR IN REPLACING EXISTING COPPERWELD SHIELD WIRE WITH ALUMOWELD.  THE WORK INVOLVED PLACING THE OLD SHIELD WIRES IN ROLLERS, REPAIRING ANY BROKEN STRANDS, AND COVERING EXISTING SPLICES ON THE WIRE TO FACILITATE PULLING IN THE NEW WIRE.  ONCE THE NEW WIRE WAS IN PLACE THE HELICOPTER CREW WOULD ATTACH THE NEW WIRE TO THE POLES AND REMOVE THE ROLLERS.  

COMPANY RECORDS FOR THE PILOT INDICATED 3,912 MILITARY FLIGHT HOURS AND A SUBSEQUENT ISSUANCE OF THE FAA COMMERCIAL PILOT CERTIFICATE WITH HELICOPTER AND INSTRUMENT RATINGS.  THE PILOT WAS ISSUED A CERTIFICATE OF COMPETENCY ON JANUARY 3, 1995, BY HAVERFIELD CORPORATION FOR CLASS A (WORK PLATFORM AND AIRBORNE WORKMAN), B, AND C, EXTERNAL LOAD OPERATIONS.

THE LOCATED PORTIONS OF THE TAILROTOR DRIVESHAFT INDICATED TORSIONAL OVERLOAD.  THE TAILBOOM PORTIONS EXHIBITED DOWNWARD BENDING.   

THE MAIN ROTOR (BLUE BLADE) LEAD LAG STRAPS, REMAINS (NOT DESTROYED BY FIRE) OF THE LONGITUDINAL/LATERAL TRIM MOTOR SYSTEM, AND THE CONTROL ROD ENDS (FOUND AMONG THE FIRE DEBRIS) WERE FORWARDED TO THE NTSB MATERIALS LABORATORY.  ON DECEMBER 12, 1995, THE FAA INSPECTOR REMOVED THE CYCLIC AND COLLECTIVE CONTROL ROD ENDS AND THE SWASHPLATE ASSEMBLY (INCLUDING THE UNIBALL).  THESE COMPONENTS WERE FORWARDED TO THE NTSB MATERIALS LABORATORY.

AN ENGINE TEARDOWN WAS COMPLETED ON DECEMBER 7, 1995, AT HOUMA, LOUISIANA, WITH NTSB OVERSIGHT.  THE EXAMINATION DISCLOSED ""ROTATIONAL DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE SHAFTING"" AND ""ALUMINUM DEPOSITS ON THE TURBINE VANES"" INDICATED THAT THE ""THE ENGINE WAS TURNING WHEN IT HIT THE GROUND.""  

THERE WERE NO DISCREPANCIES FOUND THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE ""ENGINE WAS NOT CAPABLE OF PRODUCING POWER UP TO THE TIME OF IMPACT.""                  

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION:

TOXICOLOGY FOR THE PILOT WAS POSITIVE FOR 3.800 (UG/ML) ACETAMINOPHEN DETECTED IN THE BLOOD.  THE PILOT REPORTED THAT AT 1045 HE ""TOOK 2 IBUPROFEN TABLETS TO PREVENT BACKACHE LATER IN THE DAY.""  FAA REGIONAL FLIGHT SURGEON, G. J. SALAZAR, M.D., STATED THAT THE ACETAMINOPHEN ""DETECTED IN BLOOD, IS INSIGNIFICANT.""

TEST AND RESEARCH:

METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION (REPORT ENCLOSED) OF THE SWASHPLATE ASSEMBLY, ROD ENDS, AND TRIM SYSTEM COMPONENTS DISCLOSED ""NO EVIDENCE OF PREEXISTING CRACKING.""  ALL FRACTURES ""APPEARED TYPICAL OF OVERSTRESS SEPARATIONS OR THE COMPONENTS WERE SEVERELY FIRE DAMAGED WHICH DESTROYED THE ORIGINAL FRACTURES OR CONFIGURATION OF THE PARTS.""  

WITH THE HELICOPTER CONFIGURED AS PER THE ACCIDENT AND A 15 KNOT CROSSWIND AT AN OGE HOVER, THE MANUFACTURER REPORTED THE FOLLOWING DERIVED INFORMATION: 3 INCHES OF LEFT ANTI TORQUE PEDAL WOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE WHICH EQUATES TO 39% OF LEFT PEDAL REMAINING; 3 INCHES OF RIGHT CYCLIC WOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE, WHICH EQUATES TO 25% OF RIGHT CYCLIC REMAINING AND 27% LONGITUDINAL CYCLIC; WITH MID CYCLIC EQUATED TO 50%.  THE DATA SHOWED THAT A WIND GUST OF ""30 KNOTS WOULD BE CONTROLLABLE.""  THE WEIGHT AND BALANCE LEFT LATERAL CG WAS -2.67 CG WITH A LIMIT OF -3.0 CG.  DURING THE OGE HOVER, THE TAILROTOR PLANE WAS 38 INCHES FROM THE NEAREST WIRE.  

ON AUGUST 1, 1996, AT MATERIAL ANALYSIS LABORATORY, AN NTSB INVESTIGATOR EVALUATED THE TRIM ACTUATORS AND DERIVED THE FOLLOWING TRIM DATA.  FULL TRIM TRAVEL IS 3.5 INCHES.  THE LATERAL AND LONGITUDINAL TRIM ACTUATORS HAD TRAVELED 2.6 INCHES, RESPECTIVELY.  THE CYCLIC TRIM WAS SET TO THE RIGHT AND AFT.  A SPRING INCORPORATED IN THE TRIM SYSTEM PRECLUDED A DETERMINATION OF AN EXACT CYCLIC TRIM SETTING.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

THE HELICOPTER WAS RELEASED TO THE OWNER.","THE HELICOPTER WAS HOVERING AT 55 FEET AGL, PARALLEL TO A POWER LINE CABLE, FACING EAST-SOUTHEAST. THE WIND WAS FROM 200 TO 210 DEGEES AT 5 TO 10 KNOTS. THE ROTATION PLANE OF THE TAIL ROTOR BLADES WAS ABOUT 38 INCHES FROM THE NEAREST WIRE. A CREW MEMBER, HELD BY A SAFETY HARNESS, WAS WORKING FROM THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HELICOPTER INTALLING AN OVERHEAD GROUND WIRE IN ROLLER BLOCKS. THE CREW MEMBER'S WORK PLATFORM WAS ABOUT 4 INCHES FROM THE OVERHEAD GROUND WIRE WHEN, AS THE PILOT DESCRIBED, 'THE CYCLIC SUDDENLY MOVED TO THE LEFT AND MAYBE SLIGHTLY FORWARD. (THE HELICOPER) IMMEDIATELY STARTED MOVING TO THE LEFT AND INTO THE POLE AND LINE.'  THE PILOT FURTHER STATED THAT HE WAS 'TRYING TO STOP THE CYCLIC' AND MOVE IT TO THE RIGHT; HOWEVER, 'CYCLIC MOVEMENT TO THE RIGHT HAD A RESTRICTION,' AND THE 'HELICOPTER STRUCK THE POLE AND/OR THE SHIELD WIRE, PIVOTED TO THE LEFT AND UP, OVER THE SHIELD WIRE,' AND 'BEGAN TO SPIN.'  IT IMPACTED THE GROUND, FIRE ERUPTED, AND THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST INVERTED. THE PILOT ESCAPED THE FIRE, BUT THE CREW MEMBER SUSTAINED FATAL INJURIES. INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE HELICOPTER'S CENTER-OF-GRAVITY WAS LEFT-LATERAL (-2.67 INCHES), THE LIMIT WAS -3.00 INCHES, AND ABOUT 25% OF RIGHT CYCLIC TRAVEL WAS AVAILABLE TO THE PILOT. A GOUGE MARK WAS FOUND ON THE SIDE OF THE POWER POLE MATCHING THE HELICOPTERS WORK FLATFORM. NO PREEXISTING CRACKS OR DISCONTINUITIES WERE FOUND IN UNBURNED FLIGHT CONTROLS, ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE CONTROLS WERE CONSUMED BY FIRE.",FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN CLEARANCE FROM THE POWER LINE AND UTILITY POLE.  THE GUSTY/CROSSWIND (WEATHER) CONDITION WAS A RELATED FACTOR.

ON JULY 13, 1996, ABOUT 1325 ALASKA DAYLIGHT TIME, A SIKORSKY CH-54A HELICOPTER, N541SB, CRASHED DURING AERO LOGGING OPERATIONS, ABOUT 16 MILES NORTH-NORTHEAST OF KETCHIKAN, ALASKA.  THE HELICOPTER WAS BEING OPERATED AS A VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR) LOCAL AREA FLIGHT UNDER TITLE 14 CFR PART 133 WHEN THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED.  THE HELICOPTER, REGISTERED TO AND OPERATED BY SILVER BAY LOGGING COMPANY, JUNEAU, ALASKA, WAS DESTROYED.  THE CERTIFICATED COMMERCIAL PILOT RECEIVED SERIOUS INJURIES.  THE COPILOT, HOLDER OF A COMMERCIAL HELICOPTER CERTIFICATE, RECEIVED FATAL INJURIES.  VISUAL  METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED.  THE FLIGHT ORIGINATED AT A NEARBY LOGGING CAMP ABOUT 1308.

THE OPERATOR REPORTED THAT LOGGING OPERATIONS WERE BEING CONDUCTED NEAR SHELTER COVE, LOCATED IN THE TONGASS NATIONAL FOREST.  THE HELICOPTER, A SURPLUS MILITARY AIRCRAFT CERTIFICATED IN THE RESTRICTED CATEGORY, WAS USING A 200 FOOT LONG EXTERNAL CABLE TO RETRIEVE LOGS.

THE HELICOPTER WAS OPERATING ON ITS 4TH CYCLE OF THE DAY AND WAS HOVERING ABOVE NEARBY TREES OVER AN AREA OF CUT LOGS.  GROUND PERSONNEL, COMMUNICATING WITH THE PILOT BY RADIO, HOOKED THE HELICOPTER'S CABLE TO A METAL CHOKER CABLE THAT WAS CINCHED AROUND 2 LARGE LOGS WITH AN ESTIMATED TOTAL WEIGHT OF 18,000 POUNDS.  THE HELICOPTER LIFTED THE LOGS ABOUT 60 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND WHEN A POPPING SOUND WAS HEARD COMING FROM THE HELICOPTER AND THE TAILROTOR BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN.  THE HELICOPTER WAS OBSERVED TO SPIN COUNTER-CLOCKWISE ABOUT 5 COMPLETE TURNS.  THE PILOT RELEASED THE LOAD OF LOGS FROM THE END OF THE CABLE AND COMMENTED OVER THE RADIO THAT ""WE'RE GOING DOWN"".  GROUND PERSONNEL DROPPED TO THE GROUND UNDER FALLEN TREES.  THE HELICOPTER DESCENDED TOWARD THE GROUND AND THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES STRUCK A 170 FOOT HIGH SPRUCE TREE, SEPARATING THE TOP 20 FEET OF THE TREE.  THE HELICOPTER CONTINUED TOWARD THE GROUND AND COLLIDED WITH STEEPLY SLOPED TERRAIN. 

THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED DURING THE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT AT LATITUDE 55 DEGREES, 33.33 MINUTES NORTH AND LONGITUDE 131 DEGREES, 25.09 MINUTES WEST.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER'S TAILROTOR DRIVE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF 6 INDIVIDUAL DRIVE SHAFT SEGMENTS BETWEEN THE MAIN ROTOR TRANSMISSION AND THE INTERMEDIATE GEAR BOX.  A SEVENTH SHAFT IS POSITIONED BETWEEN THE INTERMEDIATE GEARBOX AND THE TAILROTOR GEARBOX THAT IS MOUNTED AT THE TOP OF THE TAIL BOOM PYLON.  EACH OF THE 6 DRIVE SHAFT SEGMENTS ARE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER BY A COUPLING FLANGE THAT IS BOLTED TO THE AFT END OF EACH SHAFT.  A STACK OF STAINLESS STEEL DISCS, KNOW AS A THOMAS COUPLING, IS UTILIZED TO PERMIT FLEXING OF THE DRIVE SHAFT SEGMENTS AND IS INSTALLED BETWEEN THE COUPLING FLANGE AND THE AFT END OF EACH DRIVE SHAFT SEGMENT.  A THOMAS COUPLING IS COMPRISED OF BETWEEN 16 TO 22 STEEL DISCS SEPARATED BY ISOLATORS.  THE COUPLING FLANGE HAS A SPLINED CENTER SECTION THAT MATES TO THE FORWARD SPLINED END OF THE NEXT DRIVE SHAFT SEGMENT.

THE FORWARD END OF EACH DRIVE SHAFT SEGMENT HAS A SPLINED SHAFT THAT IS INSERTED INTO THE ADJOINING COUPLING FLANGE.  JUST AFT OF THE SPLINES IS A POLISHED BEARING SURFACE WHERE A SUPPORT BEARING IS INSTALLED.  THE SUPPORT BEARINGS ARE PRESSED ONTO THE DRIVE SHAFT, OVER THE SPLINES, AND ONTO THE BEARING SURFACE.  THE BEARINGS ARE INSTALLED IN A BEARING SUPPORT HOUSING THAT INCORPORATES A VISCOUS VIBRATION DAMPNER BETWEEN THE BEARING AND THE HOUSING.  THE BEARINGS ARE RETAINED IN THE HOUSING BY A SNAP RING ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BEARING.  THE BEARING SUPPORT HOUSINGS ARE ATTACHED TO THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE TAIL BOOM.  THE BEARINGS ARE LUBRICATED WITH MOBILGREASE 28 LUBRICANT.  THE NORMAL AMOUNT OF GREASE (BY WEIGHT) IN A BEARING IS BETWEEN 4 AND 6 GRAMS OR BETWEEN 30 TO 50 PERCENT.

THE OPERATOR UTILIZED TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE TAPE APPLIED TO EACH BEARING HOUSING AS INDICATORS OF BEARING HEAT.  IN ADDITION, THE HELICOPTER'S CREW CHIEF TOOK PERIODIC TEMPERATURE READINGS FROM EACH BEARING HOUSING BY USING A HAND HELD, LASER TEMPERATURE SENSOR THAT MEASURED TEMPERATURE READINGS WHILE THE HELICOPTER WAS RUNNING.  THE BEARINGS AND HOUSINGS WERE PART OF EVERY TURN-AROUND INSPECTION AND BEARING TEMPERATURES WERE HAND CHECKED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING A SHUT-DOWN OF THE HELICOPTER.

THE HELICOPTER MAINTENANCE RECORDS INDICATE THAT A VIBRATION WAS APPARENT IN THE AIRFRAME ON JULY 9, 1996.  THE CREW CHIEF FOR THE HELICOPTER REPORTED THE PILOT COMMENTED ABOUT A MEDIUM TO HIGH FREQUENCY VIBRATION.  AN INSPECTION REVEALED 6 DISCS OF THE NUMBER 7 TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT SEGMENT'S THOMAS COUPLING WERE CRACKED.  THE COUPLING WAS REPLACED AND IN ADDITION, AN INSPECTION OF THE INTERMEDIATE TAIL ROTOR GEAR BOX REVEALED 3 SLIVERS OF METAL.  A SERVICEABILITY INSPECTION OF THE INTERMEDIATE GEAR BOX WAS COMPLETED ON JULY 11, 1996, AND THE HELICOPTER WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE.

ON THE DATE OF THE ACCIDENT, THE CREW CHIEF REPORTED THE PILOT AGAIN COMMENTED ABOUT A VIBRATION.  A REINSPECTION OF THE NUMBER 7 DRIVE SHAFT REVEALED A SLIGHT BOW IN THE ALIGNMENT OF THE SHAFT.  AN ADJUSTMENT OF THE SHAFT REDUCED THE VIBRATION.  FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THE FIRST LOGGING CYCLE OF THE DAY, THE PILOT REPORTED THE VIBRATION WAS A HIGHER FREQUENCY THAN THE PREVIOUS OCCASION.  FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THE SECOND CYCLE, THE HELICOPTER WAS SHUT DOWN AND THE CREW CHIEF CONDUCTED A VISUAL AND HAND INSPECTION OF THE AIRCRAFT WITH NO UNUSUAL RESULTS.

AFTER LUNCH, THE PILOT FLEW THE THIRD CYCLE OF THE DAY AND HE COMMENTED THAT THE VIBRATION WAS BARELY BEING FELT.  THE PILOT LANDED FOR FUEL AND AN INSPECTION WAS CONDUCTED WHILE THE HELICOPTER WAS RUNNING.  THE CREW CHIEF INSPECTED THE TAIL ROTOR BEARINGS BY A HAND AND VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE BEARING HOUSINGS.  THE CREW CHIEF DID NOT NOTICE ANY SIGNS OF GREASE SPLATTERING ON THE TAIL BOOM ADJACENT TO THE BEARING HOUSINGS.  THE HELICOPTER THEN DEPARTED ON THE 4TH CYCLE OF THE DAY.  THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED DURING THE 7TH TURN OF THE CYCLE, ABOUT 17 MINUTES AFTER THE LAST INSPECTION.

TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH FORMER PILOTS OF THE HELICOPTER REVEALED A CONCERN ABOUT THE VIBRATION IN THE HELICOPTER.  ONE PILOT REPORTED PREVIOUS MOVEMENT OF THE NUMBER 5 TAIL ROTOR BEARING WITHIN ITS HOUSING, INCLUDING MIGRATING OF THE BEARING BEYOND THE SNAP RING THAT NORMALLY RETAINED THE BEARING IN THE HOUSING.

THE OPERATOR REPORTED THAT THE DRIVE SHAFT BEARINGS WERE PART NUMBER SB1111-105.  THE TAIL ROTOR BEARINGS HAD ACCRUED THE FOLLOWING HOURS IN SERVICE: NUMBER 1; SERIAL NUMBER B449-01022:  849.6 NUMBER 2: SERIAL NUMBER B449-01679:  329.7 NUMBER 3: SERIAL NUMBER B449-04132:  329.7 NUMBER 4: SERIAL NUMBER B449-04146:  329.7 NUMBER 5: SERIAL NUMBER B449-00942:  505.4

THE OPERATOR REPORTED THAT THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER MAY USE EITHER A SB1111-105 OR A SB1111-3 BEARING FOR THE TAILROTOR DRIVE SHAFT.  THE -105 TAILROTOR BEARINGS ARE NORMALLY AN ""ON CONDITION"" PART WHEN USED ON CIVIL AIRCRAFT.  FOR AERO LOGGING APPLICATIONS, THE OPERATOR ESTABLISHED A 1,000 HOUR LIFE LIMIT ON THE -105 BEARINGS.  THE -3 BEARINGS HAVE A LIFE LIMIT OF 500 HOURS THAT IS SPECIFIED IN THE MILITARY OVERHAUL MANUAL.

THE NUMBER 5 BEARING, POSITIONED BETWEEN THE NUMBER 5 AND NUMBER 6 DRIVE SHAFT SEGMENT, WAS PURCHASED IN A LOT OF 9 SB1111-105 BEARINGS FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AS SURPLUS ITEMS AT A DEFENSE REUTILIZATION AND MARKETING REGION (DRMR) SALE IN SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, ABOUT 2 YEARS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.  THE BEARING WAS PURCHASED ""AS IS"" BY THE MARSELL BEARING COMPANY, FALLBROOK, CALIFORNIA.  THE MARSELL COMPANY REPORTED THAT THE BEARING WAS PACKAGED IN ITS ORIGINAL ""FAFNIR"" BOX AND BORE THE DATE OF 1992.  THE COMPANY DID NOT KEEP ANY RECORDS OF THE PRECISE DATE OF PURCHASE NOR WAS ANY RECORD MADE OF THE SERIAL NUMBERS OF EACH BEARING.

ON NOVEMBER 2, 1994, THE NUMBER 5 BEARING, AGAIN AS A LOT OF 9 SB1111-105 BEARINGS, WAS PURCHASED FROM MARSELL BEARING BY THE AERO INDEPENDENT BEARING COMPANY, INC., SUN VALLEY, CALIFORNIA.  AERO INDEPENDENT BEARING REPORTED THAT THE BEARING WAS VISUALLY INSPECTED FOR ANY APPARENT DEFECTS.  THIS INCLUDED AN INSPECTION FOR CORROSION, WORKMANSHIP, MOUNT MARKS, AND ROTATING MOTION TO INSURE THE BEARING WAS OF A NEW, UNUSED CONDITION.  LUBRICATING GREASE (MIL SPEC, MIL-G-11796) WAS APPLIED EXTERNALLY AS A PRESERVATIVE AND THE BEARING WAS RESEALED IN SECURE PACKAGING.  THEY APPLIED A STICKER TO THE BEARING BOX THAT INDICATED ""RELUBED 10/95"".  THE AERO INDEPENDENT BEARING INSPECTION DID NOT INCLUDE DISASSEMBLY, REPACKING OF INTERNAL GREASE, OR WEIGHING OF THE BEARING TO DETERMINE ITS GREASE FILL STATE.

ON OCTOBER 16, 1995, SILVER BAY LOGGING PURCHASED A LOT OF 9 SB1111-105 BEARINGS FROM AERO INDEPENDENT BEARING.  THE PURCHASE INCLUDED THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER'S NUMBER 5 TAILROTOR DRIVE SHAFT BEARING.  THE BEARING WAS PACKAGED IN ITS ORIGINAL BOX.  THE BAR CODE LABEL FOR THE BEARING WAS RETAINED WITH THE MAINTENANCE RECORDS.  ON JANUARY 12, 1996, THE BEARING WAS INSTALLED ON N542SB, WHERE IT ACCRUED 233.3 HOURS OF OPERATION IN THE NUMBER 5 TAILROTOR DRIVE SHAFT POSITION.

ON MAY 2, 1996, BEARING SERIAL NUMBER B449-01687, INSTALLED IN THE NUMBER 5 TAILROTOR POSITION  ON N541SB (THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER), WAS REMOVED AFTER ACCRUING 409.3 HOURS.  ACCORDING TO THE MAINTENANCE LOG, THIS BEARING WAS REMOVED DUE TO THE BEARING SEAL SEPARATING FROM THE BEARING HOUSING.

IT WAS NEXT OBSERVED BY A WITNESS AS FLYING VERY LOW, AS IF TRYING TO LAND IN A FIELD AT PINE LAKE ROAD AND ALLEN/KENT ROADS, FACING NORTH.  IT CROSSED PINE LAKE ROAD AND CAME BACK VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND, BESIDE THE MIDDLE FORK OF THE LITTLE BEAVER CREEK.  ANOTHER WITNESS SAID THAT IT CONTINUED NORTH AT TREE TOP LEVEL BETWEEN KENT ROAD AND THE CREEK.  IT THEN WENT NORTH ALONG THE CREEK TOWARDS SR165.  ANOTHER WITNESS SAID THAT SOUTH OF CALLA ROAD AND WEST OF SR45 IT TURNED SOUTHEAST COMING OVER SR45, NORTH OF MIDDLETOWN ROAD, THEN WEST OF US62, AND APPEARED TO BE IN TROUBLE, IT REVERSED COURSE AND CRASHED AT ABOUT 1100.

WITNESSES ALSO REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS LOUD AND WAS HOVERING AND CIRCLING OVER THE TOPS OF 70 TO 80 FOOT TALL TREES AND POWER LINES.  WITNESSES STATED THAT AT TIMES THE HELICOPTER APPEARED TO TILT TO THE LEFT.  THE HELICOPTER WAS OBSERVED SLOWLY SPINNING WITH WHAT WAS DESCRIBED BY WITNESSES AS A LOW MAIN ROTOR RPM AS IT WENT BEHIND THE TREES. THE AIRCRAFT IMPACTED THE GROUND IN A NEAR VERTICAL DESCENT.

ONE WITNESS STATED THAT SHE HEARD THE HELICOPTER AND LOOKED UP, SHE SAID ""IT WAS IN TROUBLE, IT WAS SPINNING AROUND AS IT WENT DOWN AND I HEARD THE CRASH.""  WHEN ASKED IF THE HELICOPTER SOUNDED NORMAL SHE STATED, ""NO, I DON'T THINK SO. THAT'S WHAT GOT MY ATTENTION FIRST.""  WHEN ASKED TO DESCRIBE THE SPIN SHE STATED, ""SLOWLY GOING IN A CIRCLE. I HEARD THE NOISE AND SAID IT HAS PROBLEMS I LOOKED UP AND SAW IT SPINNING.""

ANOTHER WITNESS STATED THAT SHE WAS ON US 62, JUST PAST THE 165 INTERSECTION AND SAW THE HELICOPTER TEETER AND THEN SPIN. SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING AFTER IT WENT BEHIND THE TREES, BUT DID HEAR A FAINT THUD NOISE.  SHE WAS ASKED WHAT SHE MEANT BY ""TEETER."" SHE SAID THE HELICOPTER WENT ""SIDE TO SIDE"" HOWEVER, IT WASN'T BAD OR ELSE SHE WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WAS IN TROUBLE. SHE WAS ASKED TO DESCRIBE THE SPIN, SHE SAID THAT ""IT JUST SLOWLY SPUN ABOUT 3 TO 4 TIMES BEFORE IT WENT BEHIND THE TREES.""

ANOTHER WITNESS STATED THAT HE WAS NORTHEAST BOUND ON US 62, WHEN HE SAW A HELICOPTER NORTHEAST BOUND PARALLEL TO HIM. HE SAID IT WAS ABOUT 3000 FEET UP AND DESCENDING.  HE SAID HE WAS ""JUST SOUTH OF MIDDLETOWN ROAD AND LOST SIGHT OF IT UNTIL HE WENT A LITTLE FURTHER NORTH.""  HE SAID WHEN HE SAW IT AGAIN IT WAS ""MUCH LOWER ABOUT 800 TO 1000 [FEET], STILL NORTHEAST BOUND."" HE SAID IT THEN ""TURNED 180 DEGREES AND THE NOSE WENT UP THEN IT STARTED DOWN.  THE MAIN ROTOR WAS STILL MOVING BUT YOU COULD SEE IT HAD SLOWED AS YOU COULD SEE THE BLADES.""  HE SAID HE LOST SIGHT OF IT IN THE TREES.

WRECKAGE EXAMINATION/DOCUMENTATION

THE HELICOPTER REMAINED INTACT AND ALL COMPONENTS WERE IDENTIFIED. HOWEVER, THE FUSELAGE WAS CRUSHED AS A RESULT OF THE VERTICAL IMPACT.  THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION DECK, AND ENGINE COMPARTMENT COLLAPSED DOWNWARD ON THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT.  THE BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT WAS COMPLETELY COLLAPSED.  THE LOWER HONEYCOMB SHELL HAD SEPARATED IN FOUR PLACES, AND THE WIND SCREEN WAS BROKEN OUT.  BOTH SKID TUBES WERE FRACTURED AT THE CROSS TUBE SADDLES.  THE AFT CROSS TUBE WAS DRIVEN UP INTO THE AIRFRAME TO A POINT ABOVE THE FUEL CELL.  ALL FOUR DOORS WERE TWISTED.  THE COCKPIT SEAT, SEAT PANS WERE TWISTED AND THE UNDER SEAT CONTROL TUBES WERE FORCED INTO THE SEAT PANS.  THE REAR SEAT PAN STRUCTURE WAS BENT, TWISTED, AND TORN.  THE RIGHT FRONT LAP BELT ATTACHMENT FITTING SEPARATED FROM THE BULKHEAD.

EXAMINATION OF THE FUEL SYSTEM FOUND THAT THE FUEL CELL WAS DESTROYED WHEN THE CROSS TUBES FROM THE SKIDS WERE DRIVEN UP THROUGH THE CELL AT IMPACT.  THE FUEL SHUTOFF VALVE WAS FOUND IN THE OPEN POSITION WHICH CORRESPONDED WITH THE FUEL ON/OFF SWITCH.  IT FUNCTIONED PROPERLY WHEN ELECTRICAL POWER WAS APPLIED.  THE FUEL FILTER WAS FOUND CLEAN WITH NO CONTAMINATION.  EXAMINATION OF THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM FOUND THE FILTERS CLEAN, THE FLUID LEVEL FULL WITH NO VISUAL CONTAMINATION.  THE RESERVOIR CASE COOLING FINS ON THE LOWER RIGHT SIDE OF THE CASE WERE BROKEN OFF, AND THE HYDRAULIC PUMP SHAFT HAD SEPARATED AT THE TRANSMISSION.  EXAMINATION OF THE FLIGHT CONTROLS FOUND CONTINUITY BETWEEN THE FRACTURES. THE FORWARD AND AFT CYCLIC WAS DESTROYED BELOW THE ROOF.  THE PILOT'S CYCLIC STICK WAS BROKEN OFF 6 INCHES FROM THE BASE.  THE PILOT'S COLLECTIVE WAS BROKEN OFF AT THE BASE AND THE CONTROL HEAD WAS ALSO BROKEN IN HALF.  THE PILOT'S FOOT PEDAL ASSEMBLY WAS TORN FROM THE FLOOR MOUNTING.  ALL OF THE THROTTLE CONTROLS WERE DESTROYED BELOW THE ENGINE DECK AND THE PILOT'S TWIST GRIP WAS FOUND IN THE OFF POSITION.

EXAMINATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR HUB FOUND NO DAMAGE.  BOTH MAIN ROTOR BLADES IMPACTED THE GROUND AT THE 0700 AND 0900 O'CLOCK POSITIONS.  THE FIRST BLADE STRIKE CAUSED ONE BLADE TO FRACTURE JUST OUTBOARD OF THE BLADE ROOT DOUBLER AND IT BENT REARWARD OVER THE ROOT END.  THE SECOND BLADE WAS BENT WHEN THE FUSELAGE ROLLED TO THE LEFT AND THE BLADE STUCK IN THE GROUND.  NEITHER BLADE SPAR WAS BENT REARWARD NOR CONED UPWARD. 

EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE FOUND IT INTACT WITHIN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  THERE WAS A DENT IN THE LEFT UNDERSIDE OF THE OUTER COMBUSTION CASE, AND A PUNCTURE NEAR THE AFT PLUG.  BOTH ROTOR SYSTEMS, N1 AND N2, ROTATED AND WERE CONTINUOUS.  A FUEL SYSTEM VACUUM CHECK WAS DONE PER ALLISON DIL 57, THERE WERE NO LEAKS.  THE ENGINE WAS REMOVED AND SHIPPED TO ALLISON ENGINE COMPANY, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA FOR FURTHER TESTING.  THE TEST WAS CONDUCTED ON OCTOBER 1, 1996.  THE ENGINE WAS INSTALLED ON A TEST STAND AND RUN THROUGH A NORMAL FINAL ACCEPTANCE CHECK.

THE EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT ALL MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE HELICOPTER WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE SCENE, AND THAT THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST ON ITS LEFT SIDE, ON AN APPROXIMATE MAGNETIC HEADING OF 280 DEGREES, AT A GROUND ELEVATION OF ABOUT 1,760 FEET ABOVE MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL).  THE WRECKAGE WAS LOCATED IN A WOODED AREA ON A HILL WITH A DOWN SLOPE OF ABOUT 30 DEGREES.  THE NOSE OF THE HELICOPTER WAS CRUSHED INWARD, WITH ALL THE PLEXI-GLAS BROKEN OUT.  THE LANDING SKIDS WERE SEPARATED FROM THE FUSELAGE, AND THE FUEL TANK WAS RUPTURED WITH THE SURROUNDING SOIL SOAKED WITH FUEL.

THE TAIL BOOM WAS BENT DOWNWARD, THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT WAS INTACT, WITH MINIMAL DAMAGE TO THE TAIL ROTOR.  ONE BLADE OF THE TAIL ROTOR WAS BENT AND THE OTHER BLADE WAS STRAIGHT AND STUCK IN THE GROUND.  THE PITCH CHANGE TUBE WAS FRACTURED NEAR THE BEND IN THE TAIL BOOM, BUT EXHIBITED CONTINUITY TO THE TAIL ROTOR.  MINIMAL DAMAGE WAS FOUND TO THE LEADING EDGE OF BOTH THE MAIN AND TAIL ROTOR BLADES, WITH SCORE MARKS FOUND ON THE UNDERSIDE OF ONE MAIN ROTOR BLADE.

THE ENGINE REMAINED INTACT EXHIBITING MINIMAL DAMAGE, WITH THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT FOUND VERY CLEAN AND NO SIGNS OF FUEL OR OIL LEAKAGE.  THE FUEL CONTROL THROTTLE POSITION WAS FOUND NEAR FLIGHT IDLE, AND THE THROTTLE LINKAGE WAS JAMMED AT THAT POSITION.  THE FUEL SHUT OFF SWITCH WAS FOUND IN THE ""ON"" POSITION, AND CONFIRMED BY SIGHTING OF THE VALVE IN THE OPEN POSITION.  FLIGHT CONTROL CONTINUITY FOR THE COLLECTIVE, CYCLIC, AND ANTI-TORQUE WAS CONFIRMED.  FRACTURES OF THE COLLECTIVE, CYCLIC, AND ANTI-TORQUE TUBES, SIMILAR TO OVERLOAD, WERE FOUND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTROL TUNNEL (BROOM CLOSET).  A SMALL BAG, CONTAINING A 5/64 INCH ALLEN WRENCH, A COPY OF PAGE 3-160 AND 3-161 OF THE 250-C20 SERIES OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE MANUAL, A SET OF DUCK BILL PLIERS, AND A HEMOSTAT CLAMP, WAS FOUND IN THE BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT.

ON OCTOBER 14, 1997, THE WRECKAGE WAS REMOVED FROM THE WOODED AREA AND TAKEN TO A HANGAR.  THE ENGINE'S GAS PRODUCER AND POWER TURBINE DRIVE TRAINS EXHIBITED CONTINUITY, AND ROTATED FREELY.  THE LINEAR ACTUATOR WAS FRACTURED AT THE FORWARD CLEVIS ATTACHMENT POINT.  A CHANDLER EVANS (CECO) FUEL SYSTEM WAS ON THE ENGINE.  THE FUEL FILTER WAS CLEAN, CONTAINED FUEL, AND THE BY-PASS BUTTON WAS NOT POPPED.  ALL FUEL, AIR, AND OIL LINES WERE TIGHT, AND NO LEAKS DETECTED.  THE MAIN ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT AND THE TAIL ROTOR SEGMENTED DRIVE SHAFT EXHIBITED MINIMAL INDICATIONS OF ROTATION AT IMPACT.  THE ENGINE WAS REMOVED FROM THE WRECKAGE AND TRANSPORTED TO A TEST FACILITY.

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION AN AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED ON THE PILOT, ON OCTOBER 14, 1997, BY JAMES L. FROST, M.D., DEPUTY CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER, STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA, SOUTH CHARLESTON, WEST VIRGINIA.

THE TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING REPORT REVEALED NEGATIVE FOR DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.

TEST AND RESEARCH

THE ENGINE WAS RECEIVED AT AIRWORK CORPORATION, MILLVILLE, NEW JERSEY AND FOUND IN ACCEPTABLE CONDITION FOR OPERATIONAL TESTING.  ON NOVEMBER 4, 1997, THE ENGINE WAS STARTED, ACCELERATED, AND STABILIZED AT 100% N2.  A DYNOMETER LOAD WAS APPLIED AND AT 91% N1, AN UNCOMMANDED ENGINE SHUT DOWN OCCURRED.  THE UNCOMMANDED ENGINE SHUT DOWN REPEATED ITSELF ON SUBSEQUENT TESTS AT THE SAME POWER SETTING/PARAMETERS.  AFTER TELEPHONE DISCUSSIONS WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM CECO, THE POWER TURBINE GOVERNOR UNIT AND THE FUEL CONTROL WERE REMOVED FROM THE ENGINE AND TAKEN TO WEST HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT, ON NOVEMBER 5, 1997.

ON NOVEMBER 6, 1997, BOTH THE POWER TURBINE GOVERNOR UNIT AND THE FUEL CONTROL WERE BENCH TESTED ""AS RECEIVED"" AT CECO.  THE POWER TURBINE GOVERNOR WAS FOUND TO ""ALLOW THE SAME QUANTITY OF FUEL FLOW ENTERING THE GOVERNOR TO BE DISCHARGED BY THE GOVERNOR"" AND THE FUEL CONTROL WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE SERVICE LIMITS.  A SYSTEMATIC PLAN WAS ORGANIZED TO DISASSEMBLE THE GOVERNOR.  THE DISASSEMBLY BEGAN WITH THE INSPECTIONS OF THE MECHANICAL LINKAGE (LEVER ASSEMBLY), SPEED SENSOR ASSEMBLY AND FIXED ORIFICE, AND THE MAIN DIAPHRAGM ASSEMBLIES.  NO ANOMALIES WERE FOUND.

INSPECTION OF THE MUSCLES VALVE ASSEMBLY, WHICH CONSISTED OF A DIAPHRAGM, DIAPHRAGM CUP, THREADED VALVE AND A SELF-LOCKING HEX NUT, REVEALED THAT THE HEX NUT, P/N 94289, HAD BACKED OFF THE THREADED VALVE STEM, WITH LESS THAN ONE TURN OF THREAD ENGAGEMENT REMAINING.  THE VALVE ASSEMBLY WAS REMOVED FROM THE GOVERNOR AND TAKEN TO A BINOCULAR MICROSCOPE FOR PHOTOS.  AFTER PHOTOS WERE TAKEN, THE NUT FELL OFF THE THREADED VALVE STEM BEFORE THE EXACT ""AS FOUND"" POSITION WAS MARKED.

THE GOVERNOR WAS REASSEMBLED UTILIZING A REPLACEMENT MUSCLES VALVE ASSEMBLY AND A SPRING, AND TESTED ON THE FLOW BENCH.  THE GOVERNOR RESPONDED NORMALLY, WITH SLIGHTLY RICH AT HIGHER SPEED SETTINGS, BUT THE ACCELERATION SLOPE OF THE UNIT WAS WITHIN LIMITS.  AFTER SUPPLEMENTAL TESTING OF THE GOVERNOR, OTHER ASSEMBLIES NOT PREVIOUSLY INSPECTED WERE CHECKED AND FOUND IN FUNCTIONAL CONDITION.  THE FAILED MUSCLES VALVE ASSEMBLY AND ITS RELATED SPRING WERE TRANSPORTED TO THE MATERIALS LABORATORY DIVISION, NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD, WASHINGTON, D.C.

ON DECEMBER 8 AND 9, 1997, ADDITIONAL TESTING WAS CONDUCTED AT THE TEST FACILITIES OF ALLISON ENGINE COMPANY, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA.  THE GOVERNOR, WITH A REPLACEMENT MUSCLES VALVE ASSEMBLY AND SPRING, WAS PLACED ON THE ENGINE, WHICH WAS SPECIALLY INSTRUMENTED TO RECORD THE PARAMETERS.  SEVERAL TEST RUNS OF THE ENGINE WERE PERFORMED TO CONFIRM NORMAL FUNCTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THE CORE ENGINE AND VERIFY THE INSTRUMENTATION INSTALLED.  THEN, A TEST OF THE ENGINE WITH THE MUSCLES VALVE RETAINING NUT BACKED OFF TO ITS ""AS FOUND"" POSITION WAS CONDUCTED.  THE ENGINE WAS ACCELERATED TO MAXIMUM POWER, AT WHICH THE ENGINE EXPERIENCED A DROOP IN N2 RPM, AND THE MEASURED FUEL FLOW TO THE ENGINE WOULD NOT EXCEED 220 PPH.  THE RETAINING NUT WAS TIGHTENED TO ITS NORMAL LOCATION AND DURING THE FINAL RUN, THE ENGINE FUNCTIONED NORMALLY.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ENGINE RECORDS SHOWED THAT AT AN ENGINE TOTAL TIME OF 5,727.3 HOURS, THE TURBINE GOVERNOR, WITH ZERO TIME SINCE OVERHAUL (TSO), WAS INSTALLED ON JANUARY 22, 1997, BY HELICOPTER AVIATION SERVICES (HAS).  THE TIME RECORDED AT THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS 5,973.2 HOURS.  REVIEW OF CECO'S RECORDS INDICATED THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS RECEIVED FOR MAINTENANCE FOUR TIMES.  THE LAST OVERHAUL ON THE TURBINE GOVERNOR WAS DATED MAY TO JUNE 1996, AT CECO'S FACILITY IN WEST HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT.  THE MUSCLES VALVE REMOVED FROM THE TURBINE GOVERNOR WAS MACHINED, ASSEMBLED AND INSTALLED AT THAT TIME.

THE TURBINE GOVERNOR ""MUSCLES VALVE"" COMPONENTS WERE EXAMINED BY THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING, MATERIALS LABORATORY DIVISION.  ACCORDING TO THE MATERIALS LABORATORY FACTUAL REPORT, ""THE THREADED VALVE STEM APPEARED TO BE UNDAMAGED.  THE OUTSIDE DIAMETER WAS 0.110 INCHES (THE SPECIFICATION REQUIRES 0.1120 - 0.1069), THE ROOT DIAMETER WAS 0.0768 INCHES (THE SPECIFICATION REQUIRES 0.0832 - 0.0798) AND THE PITCH WAS 0.025 INCHES.  THE ROOT RADIUS WAS 0.002 INCHES (THE SPECIFICATION REQUIRES 0.0045 - 0.0038) AND THE FLANK ANGLES MEASURED WERE BETWEEN 62 AND 63.5 DEGREES (""V"" THREADS ARE 60 DEGREES).  THE NUT WAS PLACED ON THE THREADED VALVE STEM AND WAS FOUND TO ROTATE VERY EASILY, BY HAND, TO THE VERY END OF THE THREAD WITH NO SIGN OF RESISTANCE.""  THESE DISCREPANCIES INDICATE THAT THE NUT WAS EITHER USED PREVIOUSLY ON ANOTHER THREADED VALVE STEM OF THE CORRECT DIMENSIONS, OR INSTALLED CORRECTLY, WOULD NOT LOCK ONTO THE THREADED VALVE STEM AND LOOSENED BY THE VIBRATION OF THE HELICOPTER.

A 250-C20 SERIES ENGINE/ENGINE FUEL SYSTEM TROUBLE SHOOTING GUIDE WAS FOUND BY THE ALLISON ENGINE REPRESENTATIVE.  SECTION III WAS LABELED ""POWER TURBINE GOVERNOR TROUBLE SHOOTING, CECO GOVERNOR MODEL MC-40.""  THE INDEX SECTION LISTED VARIOUS GOVERNOR COMPONENTS OF WHICH ""MUSCLE VALVE, MALFUNCTIONS"" WERE NUMBERED 2 AND 3, AND FOUND ON PAGES NUMBERED 1 AND 2.  ON PAGE 1, LISTED UNDER GOVERNOR MALFUNCTION NO. 2 WAS: MUSCLES VALVE REMAINS IN THE CLOSED POSITION.  LISTED IN STEP ""D"" WERE THE RESULTS OF THIS FAILURE IN FLIGHT:  ""(1) FUEL FLOW GOES TO MINIMUM, (2) LOW N1 RPM, (3) LOW T.O.T., (4) LOW TORQUE, (5) N2 UNDER-SPEED IF COLLECTIVE PITCH IS NOT DECREASED, (6) POWER TURBINE GOVERNING IS LOST, (7) EXTREME LOSS OF POWER, (8) POWERED FLIGHT NOT POSSIBLE, (9) AUTO-ROTATION LANDING IS NECESSARY.""

ACCORDING TO THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE MANUAL, THE 5/64 INCH WRENCH FOUND ON SITE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS FOR LIGHT OFF ADJUSTMENT ON THE MC-40 FUEL CONTROL, NOT THE TURBINE GOVERNOR.

THE HELICOPTER WRECKAGE, EXCEPT THE ENGINE AND CAUTION WARNING PANEL, WAS RELEASED ON OCTOBER 16, 1997, TO MARK C. THOMPSON, A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OWNER'S INSURANCE COMPANY.  THE ENGINE WAS RELEASED TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY ON JANUARY 5, 1998.  THE MUSCLES VALVE COMPONENTS AND THE CAUTION WARNING PANEL WERE RELEASED ON MARCH 17, 1998.

A WITNESS SAID HE WATCHED AS THE HELICOPTER APPROACHED AND CIRCLED THE LOCAL AREA.  AS THE HELICOPTER FLEW OVERHEAD FOR THE SECOND TIME, HE WAVED HIS ARMS TO ATTRACT THE PILOT'S ATTENTION.  AS THE HELICOPTER CONTINUED PAST HIM AGAIN, HE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE TAKING AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SITE.  HE SAID THAT THE HELICOPTER APPEARED TO BE LOWER AND SLOWER ON ITS SECOND PASS OVERHEAD.  EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED UNCOMMANDED ENGINE SHUT DOWNS.  DURING BENCH TESTING, THE POWER TURBINE GOVERNOR FAILED TO LIMIT FUEL FLOW, AND DURING DISASSEMBLY IT WAS REVEALED THAT A MACHINE SELF LOCKING HEX NUT HAD BACKED OFF THE MUSCLES VALVE STEM.  EXAMINATION OF THE MUSCLES VALVE COMPONENTS REVEALED THAT THE THREADED VALVE STEM WAS BELOW THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR A UNJ THREAD, AND THE FLANK ANGLE WAS TOO LARGE.  THE TURBINE GOVERNOR, WITH ZERO TIME SINCE OVERHAUL, WAS INSTALLED ON THE ENGINE IN JANUARY 1997.  THE GOVERNOR WAS LAST OVERHAULED AT THE MANUFACTURER'S FACILITY DURING MAY-JUNE 1996.","THE IMPROPER OVERHAUL OF THE TURBINE GOVERNOR BY THE MANUFACTURER, WHICH RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF POWER."

ON FEBRUARY 26, 1998, AT 1318 HOURS PACIFIC STANDARD TIME, A ROBINSON R22, N8457J, IMPACTED TERRAIN IN A RAVINE NEAR LITTLEROCK, CALIFORNIA.  THE AIRCRAFT WAS DESTROYED AND THE COMMERCIAL PILOT/OWNER, THE SOLE OCCUPANT, SUFFERED FATAL INJURIES.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED.  THE AIRCRAFT WAS BEING OPERATED UNDER 14 CFR PART 91 AS A PERSONAL FLIGHT, AND ORIGINATED FROM A PRIVATE AIRPORT AT ADELANTO, CALIFORNIA, AT 1300.

THE RIGHT-HAND COCKPIT DOOR OF THE HELICOPTER AND PIECES OF THE WINDSHIELD PLEXIGLAS WERE FOUND IN A DEBRIS FIELD APPROXIMATELY 1/4 MILE EAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  WITNESSES REPORTED THAT WINDS AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WERE WESTERLY AT 20 TO 25 KNOTS.  ONE WITNESS REPORTED HE HEARD A LOUD ""SCHWAPP-LIKE"" NOISE FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY ENGINE SILENCE, AND THEN SAW THE HELICOPTER DISAPPEAR FROM VIEW IN A NEAR VERTICAL DESCENT.

THE PILOT OF A SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HELICOPTER LOCATED THE WRECKAGE, LANDED NEARBY, AND WAS THE FIRST PERSON ON SCENE.  HE REPORTED THAT THE SURFACE WINDS WERE FROM THE WEST AT 20 -25 KNOTS AND THAT IT WAS ""BUMPY AND TURBULENT"" IN THE AREA WHEN HE ARRIVED.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THERE WAS THE SMELL OF FUEL IN PROXIMITY OF THE FUEL TANK AND HE NOTED THAT THE CAP FROM THE FUEL TANK HAD BEEN EJECTED AND WAS LAYING ON THE GROUND OPPOSITE THE TANK, ABOUT 15 FEET UPSLOPE.  THE CITIZEN WHO HAD CALLED IN THE REPORT OF THE ACCIDENT ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AND SAID HE HAD SEEN THE AIRCRAFT ROLL TO THE LEFT AND FALL.

A FRIEND OF THE PILOT, WHO IS A STUDENT HELICOPTER PILOT, REPORTED THAT ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, THE PILOT FLEW THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER FROM WHITEMAN TO THE FRIEND'S HANGAR AT ADELANTO PRIVATE AIRPORT AND BACK.  HE DID NOT REFUEL.  THEY WERE GOING TO FLY THE FRIEND'S ROTORWAY HELICOPTER; HOWEVER, THE FRIEND SAID THAT THE WIND WAS BLOWING ABOUT 15 KNOTS AND HE WAS EXPERIENCING TRANSLATIONAL LIFT IN HOVER WHICH MADE HIM UNEASY SO HE LANDED AND PUT THE HELICOPTER AWAY.  THEY THEN GOT IN THE CAR AND DROVE AROUND THE AIRPORT FOR 3 OR 4 HOURS BEFORE THE PILOT DEPARTED FOR HOME.  THE FRIEND SAID THAT HE HAD FREQUENTLY FLOWN IN THE R22 WITH THE PILOT AND THAT HE CRUISED AT 21 INCHES MANIFOLD PRESSURE, WHICH GAVE ABOUT AN 80-KNOT INDICATED AIRSPEED.  THE PILOT ALSO HAD TOLD HIM TO SLOW DOWN IN TURBULENCE BUT NOT BELOW 60 KNOTS.

ANOTHER FRIEND, ALSO A HELICOPTER RATED PILOT, CHARACTERIZED THE PILOT AS A ""VERY CONSERVATIVE, BETTER THAN AVERAGE"" PILOT WHOM ""ALWAYS WANTED TO LEARN MORE.""  HE HAD ""GOOD ABILITY FOR A MAN HIS AGE.""  THE TWO MEN HAD ATTENDED A CFI RENEWAL CONFERENCE AT THE HAI CONVENTION IN FEBRUARY (1998) WHERE LOW-G FLIGHT AND MAST BUMPING WERE DISCUSSED.  THE FRIEND SAID ""HE WAS WELL AWARE OF IT.""

THIS FRIEND RECALLED TWO INSTANCES WHEN THEY HAD ENCOUNTERED TURBULENCE WHILE FLYING UP TO THE DESERT FROM WHITEMAN IN THE R22.  HE SAID HE WAS ALARMED BY THE AMOUNT OF [ACOUSTIC] BLADE SLAP IN THE TURBULENCE.  THEY TURNED AROUND AND WENT HOME.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT AIRSPEEDS FLOWN, THE FRIEND RECALLED THAT THE PILOT WAS ALWAYS ""VERY CONSERVATIVE IN CRUISE SETTING, A LITTLE BELOW RECOMMENDED.""

PERSONNEL INFORMATION

THE PILOT'S WIFE REPORTED THAT HE MAINTAINED TWO LOGBOOKS, ONE FOR FIXED WING FLIGHT HOURS AND ANOTHER FOR ROTARY WING FLIGHT HOURS.  AFTER THE ACCIDENT ONLY THE ROTARY WING LOGBOOK WAS LOCATED.  THE PILOT'S WIFE SAID, HOWEVER, THAT HE HAD FLOWN ROTARY WING AIRCRAFT EXCLUSIVELY FOR AT LEAST THE LAST 2 YEARS.  ON NOVEMBER 8, 1994, WHEN THE PILOT APPLIED FOR HIS AIRPLANE, SINGLE ENGINE SEA RATING CHECKRIDE, HE REPORTED HAVING 1,450 FIXED WING HOURS.

ACCORDING TO THE AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURER, THE PILOT COMPLETED THE FACTORY PILOT TRAINING COURSE IN THE AIRCRAFT IN 1994, 1995, AND IN FEBRUARY 1997.  IN THE 1995 AND 1997 TRAINING, THE COMPANY RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE PILOT'S PROFICIENCY WAS RATED ""BELOW AVERAGE.""  

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY RECOMMENDS THAT THE R22 HELICOPTER IS OVERHAULED (ENGINE AND AIRFRAME) AT 2,000-FLIGHT HOURS OR 10-YEAR INTERVALS, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST.  THE ACCIDENT AIRCRAFT WAS LAST OVERHAULED AT THE ROBINSON FACTORY IN DECEMBER 1987, AND HAD ACCUMULATED 907 FLIGHT HOURS SINCE OVERHAUL.

ACCORDING TO THE AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE RECORDS, MAIN ROTOR BLADES (SERIAL NUMBERS 3011 AND 3017) WERE INSTALLED DURING THE 1987 OVERHAUL AND WERE NEW AT THAT TIME.  THEY HAVE A 2,000-HOUR SERVICE LIFE.

RADAR DATA

A REPLAY OF RECORDED RADAR DATA AT HIGH DESERT TRACON SHOWED A VFR AIRCRAFT (TRANSPONDER CODE 1200) FLYING FROM EAST TO WEST AT 3,800 FEET (MSL) WHICH DISAPPEARED FROM RADAR AT THE ACCIDENT LOCATION AT 13:11:42 HOURS.  HIGH DESERT TRACON HAS A REHOST RADAR SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT OUTPUT RECORDED DATA.  ON MARCH 6, 1998, A SAFETY BOARD INVESTIGATOR VIEWED A REPLAY OF THE DATA ON A DISPLAY AT THE HIGH DESERT FACILITY AND MANUALLY RECORDED THE DATA (ATTACHED).  ACCORDING TO SYSTEM SPECIALISTS AT TRACON, THE SCAN RATE OF THE ANTENNA RESULTS IN A TARGET RETURN (UPDATE) APPROXIMATELY EVERY 4.5 SECONDS AND GROUND SPEEDS DISPLAYED ARE ROUNDED TO THE NEAREST 10 KNOTS USING CONVENTIONAL ARITHMETIC ROUNDING (E.G. 75 TO 84 KNOTS IS DISPLAYED AS 80 KNOTS).  THE GROUND SPEED DISPLAYED IS DETERMINED FROM THE DISTANCE TRAVELED AND ELAPSED TIME SINCE THE LAST RADAR RETURN.

AT 13:06:23, AN ARBITRARY START TIME, THE RADAR DISPLAYED THE AIRCRAFT APPROXIMATELY 7 MILES EAST OF THE ACCIDENT LOCATION AT 3,800 FEET MSL, TRACKING 255 DEGREES MAGNETIC, AT 80 KNOTS GROUND SPEED.  IN THE NEXT 5 MINUTES THE TARGET CONTINUED WESTBOUND ON APPROXIMATELY A 255-DEGREE MAGNETIC COURSE AT DISPLAYED GROUND SPEED OF 80 KNOTS, OR OCCASIONALLY 90 KNOTS, AT ALTITUDES OF 3,700, 3,800, OR 3,900 FEET.  AT 13:11:13, THE AIRCRAFT WAS 0.7 MILES EAST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE AT 3,900 FEET WITH GROUND SPEED OF 90 KNOTS.  AT 13:11:17, WHILE STILL AT 3,900 FEET, THE GROUND SPEED INCREASED TO 130 KNOTS.  IN THE TWO SUBSEQUENT RETURNS, WHILE REMAINING AT 3,900 FEET, THE GROUND SPEEDS DISPLAYED WERE 140 AND 120 KNOTS.  AT 13:11:31, THE ALTITUDE INCREASED TO 4,000 FEET AND THE GROUND SPEED DECREASED TO 100 KNOTS AND THEN, AT 13:11:36, SLOWED TO 80 KNOTS.  AT 13:11:40, THE RADAR RETURN INDICATES THAT THE AIRCRAFT REACHED 4,100 FEET AT 70 KNOTS GROUND SPEED, AND THIS IS THE LAST RETURN FROM THE AIRCRAFT.  A TABULATION OF THE RADAR DATA IS ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT.

A SYSTEMS PERFORMANCE SPECIALIST AT TRACON SPECULATED THAT THE GROUND SPEED INCREASE AT 13:11:17 MIGHT HAVE BEEN DUE TO AN ANOMALY IN THE REHOST DISPLAY SOFTWARE.  THE DISPLAY IS COMPRISED OF A MOSAIC OF RADAR MAPS AND THE AIRCRAFT WAS CROSSING A BOUNDARY FROM ONE MAP TO ANOTHER AT THAT TIME.  SEVERAL REPLAYS OF THE DATA SHOWED THE AIRCRAFT WESTBOUND WITH EQUAL DISTANCE TRAVELED BETWEEN RADAR RETURNS.  AT 13:11:13 THE TARGET MOVED AN INORDINATE DISTANCE WEST, AND THEN AT 13:11:17, MOVED BACK EASTWARD NEAR THE PRIOR RETURN.  THE SPECIALIST WAS OTHERWISE UNABLE TO EXPLAIN THIS RETURN.  THE REFERENCE BAROMETRIC PRESSURE, USED TO DECODE THE AIRCRAFT'S MODE C RETURN, WAS 29.92 FOR THE EAST MAP AND 29.93 FOR THE WEST MAP.

METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS

ACCORDING TO THE QUALITY ASSURANCE OFFICE AT THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) WESTERN REGION HEADQUARTERS, THERE WAS NO RECORD OF ANY WEATHER BRIEFING GIVEN TO THE PILOT.

A METEOROLOGY FACTUAL REPORT PREPARED BY THE SAFETY BOARD STAFF METEOROLOGIST IS ATTACHED.  THE METEOROLOGIST REPORTED THAT SURFACE OBSERVATIONS NEAR THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT FROM SURROUNDING STATIONS REPORTED WESTERLY TO NORTHWESTERLY SURFACE WINDS AT 10 TO 30 KNOTS.  WINDS ALOFT FROM THE ACCIDENT ELEVATION TO 10,000 FEET WERE NORTHWESTERLY FROM 6 KNOTS INCREASING TO 40 KNOTS, AND SEVERAL PILOTS REPORTED MODERATE TO SEVERE TURBULENCE BELOW 8,000 FEET WITH WINDS ALOFT OF UP TO 50 KNOTS AND UPDRAFTS AND DOWNDRAFTS NEAR THE MOUNTAINS.  

AIRMET TANGO 3 WAS VALID AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT FOR OCCASIONAL MODERATE TURBULENCE BELOW 12,000 FEET (MSL).  THE AIRMET WAS FOR THE AREA FROM BEATTY, NEVADA, TO 30 MILES SOUTHEAST OF SAN DIEGO, TO 50 MILES WEST OF SANTA BARBARA, AND THEN BACK TO BEATTY.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE AIRCRAFT WRECKAGE WAS LOCATED IN A SHALLOW RAVINE IN A DESERT AREA OF LOW ROLLING TERRAIN.  THE LOCATION IS IN THE NORTHERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS AT LATITUDE 34 DEGREES 30.49 MINUTES NORTH AND LONGITUDE 117 DEGREES 59.94 MINUTES WEST (GPS).  THE ELEVATION IS APPROXIMATELY 3,100 FEET MSL.  TO THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE THE TERRAIN SLOPES DOWNWARD ONTO THE MOJAVE DESERT AND, TO SOUTH OF THE SITE, RISES INTO THE MOUNTAINS.  THERE WAS NO FIRE. 

ALL OF THE AIRCRAFT WAS PRESENT AT THE WRECKAGE LOCATION EXCEPT THE WINDSHIELD PLEXIGLAS, THE WINDSHIELD CENTER BOW, THE RIGHT-HAND ENTRY DOOR, A PORTABLE FIRE EXTINGUISHER, THE AFM HOLDER BRACKET AND SOME LOOSE PAPER ITEMS.  THE PLEXIGLAS AND OTHER LOOSE ITEMS WERE LOCATED IN A FAN-SHAPED DEBRIS FIELD OVER APPROXIMATELY A 1/4-MILE AREA EAST AND EAST-NORTHEAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE LOCATION.

THE FUSELAGE WAS LYING ON ITS LEFT SIDE ORIENTED APPROXIMATELY 340 DEGREES MAGNETIC.  THE LEFT SIDE EXHIBITED CRUSHING DAMAGE THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 40 PERCENT OF THE FUSELAGE WIDTH.  WHEN VIEWED FROM THE REAR, THE PLANE OF THE CRUSHING WAS FROM APPROXIMATELY 11 O'CLOCK TO 6 O'CLOCK.  WHEN THE FUSELAGE WAS LIFTED, THERE WAS A DEPRESSION APPROXIMATELY 1-FOOT DEEP IN THE SOFT SOIL.  THERE WAS A VERTICAL INDENTATION IN THE WRINKLED COCKPIT FLOOR STRUCTURE THAT EXTENDED FROM THE NOSE OF THE AIRCRAFT AFT TO THE FORWARD LANDING SKID CROSSTUBE.  THE INDENTATION WAS APPROXIMATELY AT THE LATERAL CENTER OF THE LEFT SEAT AND EXHIBITED THE SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE LEADING EDGE RADIUS OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE.  A SIMILAR IMPACT MARK WAS PRESENT IN THE BRACKET USED TO STOW THE AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MANUAL AT THIS LOCATION.  THE BRACKET WAS FOUND IN THE DEBRIS FIELD APPROXIMATELY 150 FEET NORTHEAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  THE ROTOR BLADE EXHIBITED SCRATCH MARKS AT APPROXIMATELY THE MIDSPAN LOCATION CORRESPONDING TO THE DISTANCE FROM THE ROTOR ATTACHMENT AT THE MAST TO THE INDENTATION IN THE FUSELAGE FRAME.  THERE WAS ALSO AN INDENTATION IN THE FORWARD FACE OF THE LEFT ARM OF THE CYCLIC CONTROL, THE RADIUS OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY EQUALED THE RADIUS OF THE MAIN ROTOR LEADING EDGE.  THE MARK ON THE CYCLIC CONTROL WAS ALIGNED WITH THE MARK IN THE FUSELAGE FRAME ON AN EXEMPLAR R22 HELICOPTER AND CORRESPONDED APPROXIMATELY TO THE FULL LEFT CYCLIC CONTROL POSITION.

THE FUEL TANK WAS CRUSHED AND THE FUEL TANK CAP WAS APPROXIMATELY 25 FEET UPSLOPE FROM THE TANK.  THE ENGINE REMAINED WITH THE FUSELAGE AND THE LEFT-HAND CYLINDERS EXHIBITED IMPACT DAMAGE.  ONE OF THE TWO POWER TRANSMISSION BELTS WAS OFF THE PULLEY AT THE DRIVE SHAFT, HOWEVER, THE BELT WAS UNDAMAGED.  THE ENGINE COOLING FAN AND SHROUD DID NOT EXHIBIT ANY CIRCUMFERENTIAL SCRAPE MARKS.  THE RIGHT-HAND LANDING SKID REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE FUSELAGE ALTHOUGH BOTH ATTACHMENTS AT THE FUSELAGE WERE FRACTURED.  THE LEFT-HAND SKID, BROKEN AT THE FORWARD STRUT AND BOTH FUSELAGE ATTACHMENTS, WAS IMBEDDED IN THE DIRT BELOW THE RIGHT-HAND SKID.  A LOOSE 5-GALLON PLASTIC FUEL CONTAINER WAS FOUND IN THE COCKPIT TRAPPED UNDER THE LEFT SEAT; ALTHOUGH RUPTURED, IT STILL CONTAINED AVIATION GASOLINE.

THE TAIL BOOM, BROKEN AT THREE STATIONS, REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE FUSELAGE BY THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT AND ANTITORQUE CONTROL LINKAGE.  THE EMPENNAGE CONTROL SURFACES WERE SEPARATED FROM THE TAIL BOOM AND WERE LOCATED ABOUT 25 FEET SOUTHWEST.  THE TAIL ROTOR ASSEMBLY WAS BROKEN FROM THE 90-DEGREE GEARBOX WHERE THE SHAFT SUPPORT CASTING ATTACHES TO THE GEARBOX.  THE TAIL ROTOR HUB WITH ONE BLADE AND THE ROOT OF THE SECOND BLADE ATTACHED, WAS LOCATED 25 FEET WEST OF THE FUSELAGE.  THE SECOND TAIL ROTOR BLADE, SEVERED OUTBOARD OF THE ROOT REINFORCEMENT AREA, WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 6 FEET EAST OF THE FUSELAGE.  THE TAIL ROTOR SHAFT AND SHAFT SUPPORT HOUSING, BROKEN FROM THE 90-DEGREE GEARBOX, REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE HUB ASSEMBLY.  THE TAIL ROTOR BLADES WERE BENT TO THE SIDE, INBOARD TOWARD THE TAIL BOOM, AND DID NOT EXHIBIT ANY CHORDWISE STRIATIONS OR LEADING EDGE DAMAGE. 

THE MAIN ROTOR HUB, WITH BOTH ROTOR BLADES ATTACHED, WAS SEVERED FROM THE MAIN ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT AT THE BASE OF THE HUB AND WAS ON THE GROUND APPROXIMATELY 1 FOOT FROM THE MAIN ROTOR MAST.  ONE BLADE (S/N 3017) WAS LAYING ON THE SURFACE, LEADING EDGE DOWN, AND HAD SEVERAL SMALL COMPRESSION WRINKLES IN THE TRAILING EDGE.  THE OTHER MAIN ROTOR BLADE (S/N 3011) WAS LYING UNDER THE FUSELAGE, PASSING UNDER THE COCKPIT, TRAILING EDGE UP.  THE TIP OF THE SECOND ROTOR WAS BENT APPROXIMATELY 90 DEGREES DOWN, ABOUT 10 INCHES INBOARD OF THE TIP.  THE TIPS OF BOTH MAIN ROTOR BLADES DID NOT EXHIBIT ANY CHORDWISE STRIATIONS OR LEADING EDGE DAMAGE.  AT THE DRIVE SHAFT BREAK, THE SHAFT EXHIBITED A FLATTENED SHAPE OVER HALF ITS CIRCUMFERENCE AND A CIRCULAR SHAPE OVER THE OTHER HALF.  THE FLATTENED HALF WAS ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE HUB AS THE BLADE, WHICH WAS UNDER THE FUSELAGE.

THE CYCLIC CONTROLS WERE DISPLACED FULL LEFT AND FORWARD OF NEUTRAL.  THE LEFT ANTITORQUE PEDAL WAS FULL FORWARD AND THE COLLECTIVE WAS FULL DOWN.  THE ROTOR BRAKE SWITCH WAS OFF, THE GOVERNOR SWITCH WAS ON, AND THE CLUTCH SWITCH WAS ENGAGED.  THE LATERAL CYCLIC RIGHT TRIM CONTROL WAS PUSHED IN.

THE SAFETY BOARD EXAMINED THE AIRCRAFT ON MARCH 4, 1998, AT AIRCRAFT RECOVERY SERVICES IN COMPTON, CALIFORNIA.  THE FLIGHT CONTROL LINKAGES WERE CONTINUOUS BETWEEN THE COCKPIT AND THE SWASH PLATE ATTACHMENTS.  THE ROD END FAILURES AT THE SWASH PLATE WERE ACCOMPANIED BY BENDING IN THE THREADED AREA.  THE ANTITORQUE PEDALS WERE TRAPPED AT IMPACT IN THE FULL LEFT PEDAL POSITION.  THE FILAMENTS IN THE COCKPIT ANNUNCIATOR LIGHT BULBS FOR LOW RPM, MR CHIP, TR CHIP, AND MR TEMP WERE EVENLY SPACED AND DID NOT EXHIBIT ANY LATERAL OR LONGITUDINAL DISTORTION.  THE GLASS ENVELOPE OF THE LOW FUEL ANNUNCIATOR LIGHT BULB WAS BROKEN, HOWEVER, THE FILAMENT REMAINED INTACT AND EXHIBITED MODEST IRREGULAR STRETCHING OF THE FILAMENT WINDING ACCOMPANIED BY LATERAL (SIDEWAYS) DEFORMATION.  THE GLASS ENVELOPE OF THE CLUTCH ANNUNCIATOR LIGHT BULB WAS ALSO BROKEN AND THE FILAMENT SUPPORTS WERE BENT.  A SMALL FRAGMENT OF THE REMAINING FILAMENT EXHIBITED TIGHT, UNIFORM WINDING.  

THE FRAGMENTS OF PLEXIGLAS RECOVERED FROM THE DEBRIS FIELD WERE MATED IN A ""JIGSAW PUZZLE"" MANNER OVER AN EXEMPLAR INTACT WINDSHIELD ASSEMBLY.  THE LARGER PIECES OF PLEXIGLAS CONSTITUTED THE MAJORITY OF THE RIGHT-HAND WINDSHIELD.  APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT OF THE LEFT-HAND WINDSHIELD PLEXIGLAS COMPRISING THE CENTER AREA WAS NOT RECOVERED.

THE MAIN ROTOR AND TAIL ROTOR TRANSMISSIONS WERE OPENED FOR EXAMINATION AND NO ABNORMALITIES WERE NOTED.  THE MAGNETIC PLUG IN THE MAIN TRANSMISSION WAS FREE OF METAL.

THE THROTTLE GOVERNOR COMPUTER AND SERVO WERE TESTED AT ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY ON MARCH 11, 1998.  THE COMPUTER TESTED WITHIN LIMITS FOR IN-SERVICE UNITS AND THE SERVO TESTED WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS FOR NEW UNITS.

THE ENGINE AND SPRAGG CLUTCH WERE EXAMINED AT AIRCRAFT RECOVERY SERVICE ON MARCH 13, 1998.  THE ENGINE EXHIBITED IMPACT DAMAGE ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE AND THE COOLING BAFFLES, INTAKE AND EXHAUST PIPES, AND IGNITION WIRES ON THE NUMBER 1 AND 3 CYLINDERS WERE DESTROYED.  THE RIGHT MAGNETO AND THE CARBURETOR WERE BROKEN FROM THE ENGINE AT THERE MOUNTING BASES.  THE ENGINE AIR PATH WAS FREE OF OBSTRUCTIONS FROM THE INTAKE AND AIR FILTER TO THE MUFFLER AND THE INTERIOR OF THE EXHAUST PIPE WAS GRAY.

THE ENGINE WAS MECHANICALLY CONTINUOUS FROM THE OUTPUT SHAFT TO THE ACCESSORY CASE.  THE CRANKSHAFT AND CAMSHAFT BEARINGS WERE BRIGHT AND SHINY AND THE CAMSHAFT LOBES WERE NORMAL. THE TAPPETS WERE SHINY AND UNSPALLED.  THE ACCESSORY DRIVE GEARS WERE INTACT.  THE CYLINDERS, VALVES, AND PISTONS EXHIBITED NORMAL COLORATION AND COMBUSTION DEPOSITS.

THE LEFT AND RIGHT MAGNETOS WERE TIMED TO THE ENGINE AT 25 AND 23 DEGREES, RESPECTIVELY, AND BOTH MAGNETOS SPARKED AN ELECTRODE WHEN ROTATED BY HAND.  THE IGNITION CIRCUIT (P-LEADS) TESTED OPEN FROM THE MAGNETO LEAD TO THE IGNITION SWITCH.  THE SPARK PLUGS WERE FREE OF FOULING AND WERE LIGHT GRAY IN COLOR.

THE CARBURETOR WAS BROKEN FROM THE ENGINE SUMP AT ITS BASE THROUGH THE THROTTLE PLATE SHAFT.  THE THROTTLE, MI","WITNESSES REPORTED HEARING THE AIRCRAFT FLY OVERHEAD, THEN A 'SCHWAP' SOUND, FOLLOWED BY SILENCE.  THEY LOOKED UP AND SAW THE HELICOPTER FALLING VERTICALLY TO THE GROUND.  POSTACCIDENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT ONE MAIN ROTOR BLADE HAD ENTERED THE COCKPIT THROUGH THE LEFT WINDSHIELD HALF AND CUT THE CABIN FLOOR AFT TO THE LEFT SEAT.  THE LOCATION OF AN INDENTATION IN THE CYCLIC CONTROL CROSSTUBE, MADE BY THE ROTOR BLADE, CORRESPONDED TO THE CYCLIC CONTROL HAVING BEEN ABOUT IN THE FULL LEFT CONTROL POSITION.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION PRIOR TO THE ROTOR DIVERGENCE.  A REPORT OF METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS BY THE SAFETY BOARD SHOWED CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO MOUNTAIN WAVE TURBULENCE, AND THERE WERE PILOT REPORTS OF MODERATE TO SEVERE TURBULENCE IN THE AREA OF THE ACCIDENT.  AN AIRMET WAS IN EFFECT, CALLING FOR OCCASIONAL MODERATE TURBULENCE.  THE PILOT DID NOT RECEIVE A PREFLIGHT WEATHER BRIEFING.  THE AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MANUAL INSTRUCTED THE PILOT TO 'MINIMIZE CYCLIC CONTROL INPUTS IN TURBULENCE; DO NOT OVERCONTROL' AND TO LAND THE AIRCRAFT 'AS SOON AS PRACTICAL.'  A MANUFACTURER'S SAFETY NOTICE REGARDING FLIGHT IN HIGH WINDS OR TURBULENCE ADVISED PILOTS 'DO NOT OVERCONTROL.  AVOID LARGE OR ABRUPT CONTROL MOVEMENTS.  ALLOW THE AIRCRAFT TO GO WITH THE TURBULENCE, THEN RESTORE LEVEL FLIGHT WITH SMOOTH, GENTLE CONTROL INPUTS.'",THE PILOT'S IMPROPER USE OF THE ROTORCRAFT CYCLIC CONTROL IN RESPONSE TO ENCOUNTERING TERRAIN INDUCED TURBULENCE.  A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO OBTAIN A PREFLIGHT WEATHER BRIEFING WHICH CONTAINED PRECAUTIONARY NOTICES FOR TURBULENCE.

THE WITNESS STATED THAT AS THE HELICOPTER WAS DESCENDING THROUGH THE POWER LINES, THE TAIL BOOM SEPARATED AND THE HELICOPTER SPUN AROUND ABOUT TWO TIMES BEFORE COLLIDING WITH THE GROUND.  THE WITNESS STATED THAT THERE WERE NO UNUSUAL SOUNDS FROM THE HELICOPTER PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.  THE WIND WAS BLOWING ABOUT FIVE MILES PER HOUR AND A LIGHT DRIZZLE BEGAN TO FALL SHORTLY AFTER THE ACCIDENT.  THE WITNESS STATED THAT AFTER THE ACCIDENT HE WAS HELPING WITH THE PILOT, WHO STATED THAT HE HAD ""NO COLLECTIVE.""   

THE LINEMAN WHO WAS ON THE POLE AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WAS INTERVIEWED.  THE LINEMAN REPORTED THAT DURING THE MORNING, TRAVELERS WERE HUNG ON 12 TO 16 POLES IN PREPARATION FOR ""PULLING"" THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE THROUGH THE TRAVELERS.  AFTER THIS TASK WAS ACCOMPLISHED, THE WORKERS BROKE FOR LUNCH.  THE LINEMAN STATED THAT AFTER LUNCH, THEY RIGGED TO ""CLIP.""  THE LINEMAN DESCRIBED CLIPPING AS REMOVING THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE FROM THE TRAVELER AND PUTTING IT IN HARDWARE THAT IS PERMANENTLY ATTACHED TO THE POLE.  BREEZE DAMPERS ARE THEN INSTALLED ON THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE ABOUT FIVE FEET AWAY FROM EITHER SIDE OF THE POLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ABSORBING VIBRATION.

THE LINEMAN STATED THAT HE AND ANOTHER LINEMAN WERE DROPPED OFF BY THE HELICOPTER ON TWO SEPARATE POLES.  THE PILOT THEN WENT TO PICK UP THE LINEMAN WHO REMAINED ON THE SKID FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSTALLING THE VIBRATION DAMPERS.  

THE LINEMEN STATED THAT THE LINEMEN ARE TRANSPORTED FROM THE LANDING ZONE TO THE WORK AREAS (POLES) BY STANDING ON THE LEFT LANDING SKID.  TWO LINEMEN CAN BE TRANSPORTED AT ONE TIME.  THE LINEMEN WEAR SAFETY HARNESSES AROUND THEIR WAISTS.  A ROPE IS ATTACHED TO THE HARNESS.  THE OTHER END OF THE ROPE ATTACHES TO ONE OF TWO ATTACH POINTS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FUSELAGE.  ONE POINT IS LOCATED ON THE DOOR POST JUST BEHIND THE PILOT'S SEAT.  THE OTHER POINT IS LOCATED MID POINT, ON THE CABIN FLOOR.  THE DOOR IS REMOVED.  THE LINEMEN WEAR SPECIAL BOOTS WITH HIGHER HEELS THAT ARE USED TO BRACE AGAINST THE SKID TO PREVENT SLIPPING.  THE TOP SIDE OF THE SKID IS COVERED WITH A NON-SKID MATERIAL.

THE LINEMAN STATED THAT WHEN THE HELICOPTER RETURNED WITH THE LINEMAN ON THE SKID, THE PILOT POSITIONED THE HELICOPTER AT THE POLE AND NEXT TO THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE.  AN EXTERNAL BELLY-MOUNTED SIDE PULL HOOK ASSEMBLY IS USED.  THE LINE (ROPE) WAS DRAPED UP AND OVER THE LEFT LANDING SKID AND FORWARD OF THE FRONT LEG.  THE EXTERNAL LINE IS APPROXIMATELY FIVE FEET-FIVE INCHES IN LENGTH.  A METAL SHOE IS ATTACHED TO THE END OF THE EXTERNAL LINE WHICH HANGS DOWN ABOUT FOUR INCHES FROM THE SKID.  THE SHOE IS METAL, AND 11 INCHES IN LENGTH, AND FOUR AND A HALF INCHES WIDE.  THE SHOE IS ""U"" SHAPED WIDTH-WISE AND CRADLES THE CABLE.  THE LINEMAN STATED THAT THE PILOT POSITIONED THE HELICOPTER TO PICK UP THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE IN THIS SHOE AND POSITIONED IT IN THE SUSPENSION SHOE ON THE POLE FOR HIM SO THAT HE COULD THEN PLACE A PIN IN THE SUSPENSION SHOE.  THE PILOT THEN DESCENDED TO REMOVE THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE FROM THE EXTERNAL LINE SHOE.  THE LINEMAN STATED THAT HE WAS POSITIONED WITH HIS BACK TO THE HELICOPTER, WITH THE CABLE OVER HIS LEFT SHOULDER, AND WAS IN THE PROCESS OF PUTTING IN A COTTER KEY ON THE PIN, WHEN THE HELICOPTER MOVED OUT AND BEHIND HIM TO START INSTALLING THE VIBRATION DAMPERS.  THE LINEMAN STATED THAT EVERYTHING UP TO THIS POINT WAS NORMAL, WHEN HE HEARD A ""CLICKING"" SOUND.  THE LINEMAN STATED THAT ""IT SOUNDED LIKE THE BLADES.  IT MADE A CLICKING SOUND LIKE IT JUST HIT SOMETHING.""  THE LINEMAN FURTHER DESCRIBED THE NOISE AS, ""IT SOUNDED LIKE A BIKE, LIKE WHEN YOU STICK CARDS IN THE SPOKE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.""  THE LINEMAN STATED THAT OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE, HE SAW PIECES OF THE HELICOPTER FLYING.  THE LINEMAN STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS BEHIND HIM AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN BESIDE HIM SO HE KNEW THAT IT WAS INTO THE WIRES.  THE LINEMAN DUCKED DOWN ON THE POLE, AND WHEN HE JUMPED CLEAR, THE POLE WAS ""KIND OF SHAKING"" AND THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE WAS CUT.  WHEN HE LOOKED UP, THE HELICOPTER WAS ALREADY ON THE GROUND.

THE OTHER LINEMAN, WHO WAS ON ANOTHER POLE, STATED THAT HE WAS IN THE PROCESS OF CLIPPING WHEN HE FELT HIS POLE MOVE.  THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE WENT SLACK, AND WHEN HE TURNED AROUND, THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE WAS SEVERED AND THE HELICOPTER WAS ALREADY SPINNING AND INTO THE WIRES.

CRUSH DAMAGE TO THE AIR INLET FAIRING WAS NOTED AND FOREIGN OBJECT DEBRIS WAS PRESENT IN THE ENGINE INLET AREAS.  FURTHER INSPECTION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED THAT THE GAS PRODUCER TURNED, WITH SOME RESISTANCE TO ROTATION WITH EACH REVOLUTION.  THE N2 SYSTEM WAS FREE AND TURNED SMOOTHLY.  ALL IMPELLER VANES DISPLAYED LEADING EDGE FOREIGN OBJECT DAMAGE.  GOVERNOR CONTROL CONTINUITY WAS ESTABLISHED.  IT WAS NOTED THAT IT WAS RESTRICTED IN THE MINIMUM DIRECTION AND THE POINTER READ 80 DEGREES.  THROTTLE CONTROL CONTINUITY WAS ESTABLISHED TO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  THE LINKAGE WAS SHEARED JUST FORWARD OF THE FUEL CONTROL THROTTLE ARM ROD.  THE FUEL CONTROL POINTER WAS AT 0 DEGREES, HOWEVER, THIS WAS NOT OBSERVED UNTIL AFTER THE WRECKAGE WAS RECOVERED TO THE HANGAR.  A LARGE AMOUNT OF GRASS WAS FOUND IN THE INLETS OF BOTH THE LEFT AND RIGHT PARTICLE SEPARATORS.  GRASS WAS ALSO FOUND PROTRUDING FROM THE ASSEMBLY SEAMS OF THE VORTEX TUNNELS. 

TESTS AND RESEARCH

THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE MEASURED APPROXIMATELY 5/8 INCH IN DIAMETER.  THE CABLE CONSISTED OF 22 STRANDS.  FIFTEEN SOLID ALUMINUM STRANDS MEASURING .11 INCH IN DIAMETER SURROUNDED SEVEN INNER STRANDS.  THE SOLID ALUMINUM CORE STRAND MEASURED .14 INCH DIAMETER.  SIX STRANDS SURROUND THE CORE.  OTHER STRANDS, AROUND THE CORE STRAND, CONSISTED OF THREE SOLID ALUMINUM STRANDS MEASURING .14 INCH IN DIAMETER, AND THREE STRANDS OF TUBES MEASURING .14 INCH IN DIAMETER.  EACH TUBE HOUSED FIBER OPTIC STRANDS.

DURING THE INVESTIGATION, THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE WAS REMOVED FROM THE TOP OF THE POLE.  THE CABLE MEASURED APPROXIMATELY 24 FEET-SIX INCHES FROM THE CUT END TO THE SEPARATED END.  EVIDENCE OF SCRAPING DAMAGE ON SEVERAL OF THE OUTER STRANDS STARTED ABOUT NINE FEET FROM THE CUT END AND TRAVELED ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE CABLE TO THE FRAYED END.  FOUR OUTER STRANDS WERE NOTED TO HAVE SEPARATED AT A CLOSER DISTANCE TO THE CUT END THAN THE OTHERS.  STRAND 1 BROKE APPROXIMATELY 11 FEET-SIX INCHES FROM THE CUT END.  THE END OF THE STRAND WAS NECKED DOWN, WITH ONE HALF OF THE STRAND PARTIALLY FLATTENED.  STRAND 2 BROKE APPROXIMATELY 11 FEET-11 INCHES FROM THE CUT END.  THE END OF THE STRAND WAS NECKED DOWN.  A GOUGE STARTING APPROXIMATELY AT SIX INCHES FROM THE END RAN ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE STRAND.  STRAND 3 BROKE APPROXIMATELY 14 FEET-FOUR INCHES FROM THE CUT END.  THE END WAS NECKED DOWN WITH FLATTENING ON ONE SIDE OF THE STRAND.  OTHER FLATTENING SIGNATURES WERE NOTED ABOUT TEN INCHES FROM THE CUT END.  STRAND 4 BROKE APPROXIMATELY 14 FEET-FOUR INCHES FROM THE CUT END.  THE END WAS NECKED DOWN WITH ONE SIDE OF THE STRAND FLATTENED.  CONTINUED SCRAPING DAMAGE WAS NOTED TO ABOUT 15 FEET FROM THE CUT END.  THE REMAINING EIGHTEEN STRANDS SEPARATED AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME POINT.

BOTH SEPARATED ENDS OF THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE WERE SENT TO THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD MATERIALS LABORATORY, WASHINGTON D.C., FOR EXAMINATION.  THE TECHNICIAN REPORTED THAT THREE OF THE OUTER .11 INCH DIAMETER STRANDS SEPARATED IN A TENSILE MODE WITH A REDUCTION IN AREA, AND A TYPICAL CUP OR CONE FEATURE AT THE FRACTURE.  THE REMAINING 19 STRANDS RECEIVED VARYING AMOUNTS OF MECHANICAL DAMAGE PRIOR TO FAILURE.

THE TRANSMISSION OIL PRESSURE, FUEL LEVEL LOW, AND ENGINE OUT CAUTION/WARNING INDICATORS WERE REMOVED AND SENT TO THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD MATERIALS LABORATORY TO VIEW THE FILAMENTS IN THE FOUR MINI-LAMPS FOR EACH INDICATOR.  THE TECHNICIAN REPORTED THAT THE FILAMENTS IN THE FOUR MINI-LAMPS INSTALLED IN THE FUEL LEVEL LOW INDICATOR REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF STRETCHING OR FRACTURES.  ELECTRICAL CONTINUITY WAS ESTABLISHED WITH AN OHM METER THAT INDICATED THAT THE FILAMENTS WERE INTACT.

EXAMINATION OF THE LAMPS FOR THE TRANSMISSION OIL PRESSURE AND THE ENGINE OUT INDICATORS REVEALED THAT ALL OF THE FILAMENTS WERE SEVERELY STRETCHED.  THE FILAMENT IN ONE OF THE LAMPS FOR THE ENGINE OUT INDICATOR WAS FRACTURED.  ELECTRICAL CONTINUITY WITH AN OHM METER INDICATED THAT THE FILAMENTS IN THE REMAINING SEVEN LAMPS WERE INTACT. 

ADDITIONAL DATA/INFORMATION

THE ENGINE WAS REMOVED AND TRANSPORTED TO AIR SERVICES INTERNATIONAL, INC., SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA, FOR INSPECTION AND TEARDOWN.  UPON INITIAL INSPECTION, FERROUS CHIPS ON THE UPPER DETECTOR OF THE MAGNETIC CHIP PLUGS WERE FOUND THAT ORIGINATED FROM THE NO. 1 BEARING (COMPRESSOR FORWARD SUPPORT).  IN ORDER TO FACILITATE AN ENGINE RUN, THE BEARING WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH A NEW ONE.  DAMAGE TO THE BEARING WAS NOTED TO THE INNER RACE, INNER RACE BALLS AND BALL RETAINER.

THE ENGINE WAS INSTALLED IN A TEST CELL.  INITIAL ATTEMPTS TO START THE ENGINE RESULTED IN HUNG STARTS AND IT WOULD NOT ACCELERATE TO IDLE SETTING.  THE AIR LINES WERE INSPECTED AND ONE FITTING AT THE AIR ACCUMULATOR WAS FOUND LOOSE.  THE FITTING WAS TORQUED TO SPECIFICATIONS AND THE ENGINE THEN SUCCESSFULLY STARTED.  THE ENGINE WAS TESTED TO OBTAIN FIVE POWER POINTS.  A COMPRESSOR SURGE WAS","WITNESSES REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER HAD JUST RELEASED FROM POSITIONING A FIBER OPTIC CABLE ON TOP OF A POWER POLE. AN EXTERNAL LINE IS HUNG OVER THE LEFT LANDING SKID, FORWARD OF THE FRONT LEG, AND A SHOE IS USED TO CRADLE THE CABLE TO LIFT AND POSITION IT IN PLACE FOR PERMANENT ATTACHMENT. A LINEMAN WAS ON THE POLE AND IN THE PROCESS OF PERMANENTLY ATTACHING THE CABLE TO THE POLE WHEN THE PILOT MANEUVERED THE HELICOPTER AWAY AND BEHIND THE LINEMAN ABOUT FIVE FEET. ANOTHER LINEMAN WAS STANDING ON THE LEFT SIDE LANDING SKID AND WAS THEN GOING TO INSTALL VIBRATION DAMPERS ON THE CABLE.  THE LINEMAN ON THE POLE STATED THAT EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL WHEN HE HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A CLICKING SOUND OR A SOUND LIKE A CARD IN A SPOKED WHEEL.  THE LINEMAN ON THE POLE STATED THAT HE KNEW THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS IN THE WIRES AND SAW PIECES OF THE HELICOPTER FLYING.  THE LINEMAN DUCKED DOWN ON THE POLE, AND WHEN HE LOOKED UP AGAIN, THE HELICOPTER HAD ALREADY GONE THROUGH THE TRANSMISSION WIRES AND WAS LAYING ON ITS RIGHT SIDE ON THE GROUND.  IMPACT SIGNATURES OF A CABLE STRIKE WERE FOUND ON BOTH TAILROTOR BLADES.  THE CABLE THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS POSITIONED NEXT TO WAS SEVERED.  FURTHER INSPECTION OF THE SEVERED CABLE NOTED THAT 19 OF THE 22 STRANDS THAT MAKE UP THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE RECEIVED VARYING AMOUNTS OF MECHANICAL DAMAGE PRIOR TO FAILURE.  DURING THE POST-CRASH WRECKAGE DOCUMENTATION AND INSPECTION, NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND TO INDICATE A MECHANICAL FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION.",FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CLEARANCE FROM WIRES.  A TRANSMISSION WIRE WAS A FACTOR.

ON AUGUST 11,1998, AT 1832 EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME, A HOMEBUILT REVOLUTION MINI 500 HELICOPTER, N2XK, WAS DESTROYED DURING COLLISION WITH TERRAIN FOLLOWING AN UNCONTROLLED DESCENT NEAR NORTHHAMPTON, PENNSYLVANIA.  THE CERTIFICATED COMMERCIAL PILOT WAS FATALLY INJURED.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED FOR THE MAINTENANCE TEST FLIGHT THAT ORIGINATED AT BANGOR, PENNSYLVANIA, APPROXIMATELY 1800.  NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE FLIGHT CONDUCTED UNDER 14 CFR PART 91.

IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW, ONE WITNESS STATED HIS ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO THE HELICOPTER BECAUSE IT SOUNDED UNUSUAL.  HE SAID THE HELICOPTER WAS MANEUVERING APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET IN THE AIR.  THE WITNESS SAID:

""I SAW IT CIRCLE AROUND BUT IT DIDN'T SOUND TOO GOOD.  I HEARD IT MAKING THESE WEIRD NOISES.  IT STOPPED IN THE AIR AND THEN TURNED TOWARDS MY HOUSE.  I HEARD IT GO 'POW' THEN ANOTHER SHARP 'SNAP'.  IT SOUNDED LIKE A GUNSHOT.  THEN I SAW THIS PIECE FLYING.  THE HELICOPTER ROTATED APPROXIMATELY ONE-QUARTER TURN, THE TAIL CAME UP, THE NOSE DROPPED, AND THEN THE AIRCRAFT FELL OUT OF SIGHT.""

IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW, A SECOND WITNESS SAID HIS ATTENTION WAS DRAWN BY THE SOUND.  HE STATED:

""IT SOUNDED LIKE A HELICOPTER, BUT IT HAD A FUNNY SOUND, IT HAD A RAT-A-TAT-TAT SOUND.  I COULDN'T SEE IT, THEN I SAW HIM MAKE A RIGHT HAND TURN HEADING DUE WEST GAINING ALTITUDE.  I HEARD A 'POOF-POOF'...JUST THE SOUNDS OF THE ROTORS DIDN'T SOUND NORMAL.  I HEARD THE LIGHTER 'POP' AND THEN THE LOUDER 'POP'.""

THE WITNESS STATED THE HELICOPTER THEN DESCENDED BEHIND A TREE LINE OUT OF VIEW.

THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED DURING THE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT APPROXIMATELY 42 DEGREES, 28 MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE, AND 76 DEGREES, 8 MINUTES WEST LONGITUDE.

THE FAA INSPECTOR INTERVIEWED THE PILOT'S SON REGARDING ANY WORK PERFORMED ON THE HELICOPTER AND THE PURPOSE OF THE FLIGHT.  ACCORDING TO THE INSPECTOR'S REPORT:

""HIS SON INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS ASSISTING HIS FATHER WITH ROTOR TRACKING BY HOLDING THE TRACKING FLAG AND HIS FATHER WAS ADJUSTING THE BLADE TRACK WITH THE PITCH CHANGE LINKS.  THE SON LEFT PRIOR TO HIS FATHER FINISHING THE GROUND PORTION OF THE CHECKS AND WHEN HE RETURNED THE AIRCRAFT AND HIS FATHER WERE GONE.""

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

WEATHER REPORTED AT ALLENTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA, APPROXIMATELY 15 MILES SOUTHWEST OF THE ACCIDENT WAS: FEW CLOUDS AT 3,000 FEET WITH WINDS FROM 270 DEGREES AT 7 KNOTS.

WRECKAGE INFORMATION

THE WRECKAGE WAS EXAMINED AT THE SITE ON AUGUST 12, 1998, BY A TEAM OF FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) AVIATION SAFETY INSPECTORS.  ALL MAJOR COMPONENTS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE SCENE.  ACCORDING TO ONE INSPECTOR'S STATEMENT:

""THE HELICOPTER WRECKAGE SHOWED A VERTICAL IMPACT WHERE THE AIRCRAFT WRECKAGE REMAINED WITHIN A VERY CONFINED AREA.  NO WRECKAGE WAS MORE THAN A FEW FEET FROM THE FUSELAGE.  THE ONLY PART OF THE AIRCRAFT NOT WITHIN THE MAIN FUSELAGE WAS ONE MAIN ROTOR BLADE THAT WAS DISCOVERED OVER 400 FEET FROM THE AIRCRAFT.

UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE CRASH SITE, I OBSERVED THAT THE PITCH HORN (A CASTING) WAS FRACTURED ON ONE OF THE MAIN ROTOR HUBS AND DISCONNECTED.  THE BLADE YOKE WAS STILL ATTACHED BUT ONLY ABOUT TWELVE INCHES OF THE BLADE WAS ATTACHED.  THIS PART MATCHED WITH THE BLADE ASSEMBLY THAT WAS OVER 400 FEET FROM THE WRECKAGE.  THE REST OF THE HUB ASSEMBLY WAS FOUND INTACT AND ALL CONTROL RODS AND ASSEMBLIES WERE ATTACHED.  THE MAST SHOWED NO SIGNS OF MAST BUMPING OR DEFORMATION.  THE TAILBOOM ASSEMBLY AND TAIL ROTOR ASSEMBLY SHOWED NO SIGNS OF MAIN ROTOR BLADE CONTACT NOR PRIOR DAMAGE BEFORE IMPACT...THE PITCH CHANGE ROD TO THE HUB WITH THE MISSING MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS LOOSE AND THE JAM NUTS TO THE ROD AND BEARINGS WERE LOOSE AND NOT TORQUED AT ALL.""

THE FAA FORWARDED PORTIONS OF THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM TO THE NTSB MATERIALS LABORATORY IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION.  THE REMAINDER OF THE WRECKAGE WAS RECOVERED AND STORED BY A COLLEAGUE OF THE PILOT'S.  THE WRECKAGE WAS LATER MOVED TO THE NTSB MATERIALS LABORATORY IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION.

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

THE FAA TOXICOLOGY ACCIDENT RESEARCH LABORATORY, OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA PERFORMED TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING FOR THE PILOT.  TEST RESULTS REVEALED VERAPAMIL AND NOVERAPAMIL WERE DETECTED IN THE BLOOD AND URINE.

DR. SAMUEL LAND PERFORMED AN AUTOPSY ON THE PILOT ON AUGUST 12, 1998, FOR THE NORTHAMPTON COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE.

TESTS AND RESEARCH

ON OCTOBER 9, 1998, THE FRACTURED MAIN ROTOR BLADE AND PITCH HORN WERE EXAMINED IN THE NTSB MATERIALS LABORATORY IN WASHINGTON, D.C.  ACCORDING TO THE METALLURGIST'S FACTUAL REPORT, EXAMINATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR SPAR FRACTURE AND THE PITCH HORN FRACTURE SURFACES REVEALED EVIDENCE TYPICAL OF OVERSTRESS FRACTURE WITH NO EVIDENCE OF FATIGUE.

ON JANUARY 26, 1999, THE ENGINE WAS EXAMINED IN THE NTSB MATERIALS LABORATORY IN WASHINGTON, D.C.  THE CARBURETORS, ALL HOSES, AND THE 2-CYCLE OIL TANK WERE NOT INSTALLED.  FIRE AND IMPACT EXTENSIVELY DAMAGED THE EXTERIOR OF THE ENGINE.

REMOVAL OF THE FOUR SPARK PLUGS REVEALED THE ELECTRODES WERE BLACK, WITH OILY SOOT DEPOSITS.  THE ELECTRODE GAPS WERE MEASURED AND THREE OF THE FOUR WERE FOUND TO BE 0.030 INCHES.  THE FOURTH WAS MEASURED AT 0.032 INCHES.  THE ELECTRODE GAP SPECIFIED BY THE MANUFACTURER WAS 0.020 PLUS OR MINUS 0.002 INCHES.

THE ENGINE WAS DISASSEMBLED AND THE PISTONS AND CYLINDERS WERE EXAMINED.  CYLINDER WALLS, BEARINGS, O-RINGS AND SEALS ALL SHOWED EVIDENCE OF FIRE DAMAGE.  THE PISTONS AND THE CYLINDER WALLS DISPLAYED NO EVIDENCE OF MECHANICAL DAMAGE OR SEIZURE.

ON JANUARY 27, 1999, THE TAILBOOM AND REMAINING AIRFRAME COMPONENTS WERE EXAMINED IN THE NTSB MATERIALS LABORATORY IN WASHINGTON, D.C.  THE COCKPIT, FUSELAGE, ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION PYLON AREAS WERE COMPLETELY DESTROYED BY FIRE AND IMPACT DAMAGE.  EXAMINATION OF THE TAILBOOM REVEALED IMPACT DAMAGE CONSISTENT WITH THE SIZE AND CURVATURE OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE SPAR.  THE TAILBOOM AND TAIL ROTOR DRIVESHAFT ALSO DISPLAYED TORSIONAL DAMAGE AT THE POINT OF IMPACT.

MATERIALS CONSISTENT WITH THE FIBERGLASS AND FOAM CORE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS FOUND EMBEDDED BENEATH THE BOLT HEAD OF A TAIL ROTOR DRIVESHAFT HANGER BEARING ATTACHMENT BOLT.

CHORDWISE IMPACT DAMAGE TO ONE ROTOR BLADE WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE DIMENSIONS OF THE HEAD OF THE HANGER BEARING ATTACHMENT BOLT.  THE LOCATION OF THE HANGER BEARING AND THE ROTOR BLADE DAMAGE ARE AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME POSITION INBOARD OF THE ROTOR TIP-PATH PLANE.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ACCORDING TO FAA ADVISORY CIRCULAR 20-27A-CERTIFICATION AND OPERATION OF AMATEUR-BUILT AIRCRAFT:

""THE FAA DOES NOT FORMALLY APPROVE THESE DESIGNS SINCE IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DEVELOP DESIGN STANDARDS FOR THE MULTITUDE OF UNIQUE DESIGN CONFIGURATIONS GENERATED BY KIT MANUFACTURERS AND AMATEUR BUILDERS.  SINCE 1983, FAA INSPECTIONS OF AMATEUR-BUILT AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO ENSURING THE USE OF ACCEPTABLE WORKMANSHIP METHODS, TECHNIQUES, PRACTICES, AND ISSUING OPERATING LIMITATIONS NECESSARY TO PROTECT PERSONS AND PROPERTY NOT INVOLVED IN THIS ACTIVITY.""

THE WRECKAGE WAS RELEASED TO THE OWNER'S FAMILY ON AUGUST 1, 1999.","THE PILOT DEPARTED HIS HOME IN THE HOME-BUILT HELICOPTER ON A MAINTENANCE TEST FLIGHT.  THE PURPOSE OF THE FLIGHT WAS TO TRACK THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM AFTER REPAIR AND RE-ASSEMBLY OF THE HELICOPTER.  THE MAIN TRANSMISSION, TRANSMISSION MAST, MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM, AND TAILBOOM AND ASSOCIATED COMPONENTS HAD BEEN REPLACED FOLLOWING A ROLLOVER ACCIDENT. THE PILOT CHANGED THE BLADE TRACK BY ADJUSTMENT OF THE PITCH CHANGE LINKS DURING GROUND RUNS PRIOR TO TAKEOFF.  WITNESSES TO THE ACCIDENT REPORTED UNUSUAL SOUNDS FROM THE HELICOPTER BEFORE TWO SHARP REPORTS AND AN UNCONTROLLED DESCENT.  ONE MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS FOUND 400 FEET FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED ROTOR TO TAILBOOM CONTACT.  FRACTURE SEPARATION OF ONE ROTOR BLADE AND FRACTURE OF THE PITCH HORN ON THE SAME SIDE WERE DUE TO OVERLOAD. THE PITCH CHANGE LINK BARREL WAS LOOSE ON THE FRACTURED HORN WITH NO TORQUE APPLIED TO THE BARREL NUTS.",THE IMPROPER MAINTENANCE ADJUSTMENT AND THE FAILURE TO PROPERLY TORQUE THE PITCH-CHANGE LINK BARREL BY THE OWNER/BUILDER WHICH RESULTED IN MAIN ROTOR TO TAILBOOM CONTACT AND MAIN ROTOR SEPARATION.

CREW INFORMATION

THE PILOT HELD A PRIVATE PILOT CERTIFICATE, WITH A ROTORCRAFT HELICOPTER RATING THAT WAS ISSUED ON JANUARY 22, 1991.  THE MOST RECENT THIRD CLASS MEDICAL CERTIFICATE WAS ISSUED TO THE PILOT ON JANUARY 13, 1992, AND CONTAINED NO LIMITATIONS.  ON THE APPLICATION FOR THE MEDICAL CERTIFICATE, THE PILOT LISTED HIS TOTAL ACCUMULATED PILOT TIME AS 210 HOURS, WITH 50 HOURS ACCRUED IN THE PREVIOUS 6 MONTHS.

COMPLETE FLIGHT RECORDS FOR THE PILOT WERE NOT RECOVERED AND THE AERONAUTICAL EXPERIENCE LISTED IN THIS REPORT WAS OBTAINED FROM A REVIEW OF THE AIRMAN FAA RECORDS ON FILE IN THE AIRMAN AND MEDICAL RECORDS CENTER LOCATED IN OKLAHOMA CITY.  IN ADDITION, PARTIAL PILOT LOGBOOK PAGES FROM ROBINSON HELICOPTERS FILES AND A PORTION OF FIRE DAMAGED LOGBOOK PAGES WERE REVIEWED.

ACCORDING TO THE PILOT/OPERATOR REPORT SUBMITTED BY THE OPERATOR, THE PILOT'S TOTAL AERONAUTICAL EXPERIENCE CONSISTED OF 640 HOURS, OF WHICH 60 HOURS WERE ACCRUED IN THE ACCIDENT AIRCRAFT MAKE AND MODEL.  IN THE PRECEDING 90 AND 30 DAYS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT, THE REPORT LISTS A TOTAL OF 50 AND 10 HOURS RESPECTIVELY FLOWN.

SAFETY BOARD INVESTIGATORS ATTEMPTED TO VALIDATE AND RECONSTRUCT THE PILOT'S EXPERIENCE.  ON NOVEMBER 11, 1992, THE PILOT ATTENDED A THREE DAY ROBINSON R22 SAFETY COURSE, CONDUCTED BY ROBINSON HELICOPTERS.  AT THAT TIME, THE PILOT INDICATED THAT HE HAD ACCRUED 425 HOURS OF FLIGHT TIME.  ROBINSON HELICOPTERS REQUIRED 500 HOURS OF TOTAL TIME TO ACT AS PILOT-IN-COMMAND OF AN R44.  ON MAY 28, 1993, THE PILOT ATTENDED A ONE DAY R44 PILOT CHECK-OUT TRAINING COURSE AT ROBINSON HELICOPTERS.  AS VERIFICATION THAT THE PILOT THAT ACCRUED 500 HOURS OF FLIGHT TIME, THE PILOT SENT A FACSIMILE OF TWO PAGES OF A LOGBOOK TO ROBINSON HELICOPTERS THAT REFLECTED A TOTAL TIME OF 525.2 HOURS.  THE LOGBOOK PAGES WERE NOT DATED.

AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE R44 TRAINING, THE INSTRUCTOR PILOT FROM ROBINSON HELICOPTERS ISSUED THE PILOT A CERTIFICATE OF TRAINING AFTER FINDING THAT THE PILOT'S PERFORMANCE WAS SATISFACTORY TO FLY THE R44 AS A 2-PLACE HELICOPTER FOR AT LEAST 50 INITIAL HOURS.  TO QUALIFY TO CARRY MORE THAN 1 PASSENGER, THE PILOT NEEDED TO RETURN FOR ANOTHER FLIGHT CHECK AFTER GAINING THE REQUIRED R44 FLIGHT TIME.  ON JULY 22, 1993, THE PILOT RETURNED TO ROBINSON HELICOPTERS FOR HIS SECOND FLIGHT CHECK IN THE R44.  THE INSTRUCTOR PILOT DID NOT REQUIRE THE PILOT TO PRODUCE ANY VERIFICATION THAT THE PILOT HAD ACCRUED AN ADDITIONAL 50 HOURS OF R44 FLIGHT TIME.  THE INSTRUCTOR PILOT VERBALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PILOT WAS AUTHORIZED TO CARRY MORE THAN ONE PASSENGER; HOWEVER, HE DID NOT ISSUE A NEW CERTIFICATE OF TRAINING AT THAT TIME.

THE OPERATOR PRODUCED A COPY OF A PILOT LOGBOOK RECOVERED FROM THE HELICOPTER WRECKAGE THAT WAS FIRE DAMAGED.  THE LOGBOOK PAGES APPEARED TO REFLECT FLIGHT TIME ACCUMULATED BY THE PILOT IN THE R44.  THE RECORD DID NOT REFLECT THE DATES OF VARIOUS FLIGHTS; HOWEVER, THE TWO PAGES TOTALED 35.0 HOURS.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

THE RECORDING HOUR METER IN THE HELICOPTER WAS DESTROYED.  EXAMINATION OF THE FIRE DAMAGED AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE LOGBOOK REVEALED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS MANUFACTURED ON FEBRUARY 12, 1993.  A 100-HOUR INSPECTION WAS COMPLETED BY ROBINSON HELICOPTERS ON MAY 21, 1993, AT AN HOUR METER READING OF 104.0, 70 HOURS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.  THE HELICOPTER WAS PURCHASED BY THE OPERATOR ON MAY 27, 1993.  AT THAT TIME THE HELICOPTER HAD ACCRUED 106 HOURS.  THE OPERATOR AND A FLIGHT TEST MECHANIC FOR ROBINSON HELICOPTERS REPORTED THAT JUST PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT, THE HELICOPTER HAD ACCUMULATED A TOTAL TIME IN SERVICE OF ABOUT 174 FLIGHT HOURS.

THE LAST ENTRY IN THE MAINTENANCE LOGBOOK WAS JULY 14, 1993, AT A HOUR METER READING OF 158.9.  ON THAT DATE THE LOW ROTOR RPM WARNING HORN UNIT WAS REPLACED AND THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE RE-TRACKED BY A ROBINSON HELICOPTER MECHANIC.  THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE TRACKING WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY ADJUSTMENT OF A TRAILING EDGE TAB.  NO PORTION OF THE FLIGHT CONTROLS, SWASH PLATE ASSEMBLY, OR PITCH CHANGE LINKS WERE DISTURBED.  THE CYCLIC CONTROL ASSEMBLY INSTALLED IN THE HELICOPTER WAS REVISION H.

THE FUEL SYSTEM IS GRAVITY-FED (NO FUEL PUMPS) FROM THE MAIN FUEL TANK.  AN AUXILIARY FUEL TANK (SMALLER AND MOUNTED HIGHER THAN THE MAIN) DRAINS INTO THE MAIN TANK THROUGH AN INTER-CONNECTING LINE.

ON NOVEMBER 19, 1993, AT 0346 CENTRAL STANDARD TIME, A HUGHES 369HS, N9179F, OPERATED AS A PUBLIC USE AIRCRAFT BY THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION (DEA), IMPACTED TREES AND TERRAIN WHILE ON A TRAINING MISSION NEAR ANTONIA, MISSOURI.  THE PILOT SUSTAINED SERIOUS INJURIES AND THE PASSENGER (OBSERVER) RECEIVED FATAL INJURIES.  THE HELICOPTER SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.  THE 14 CFR PART 91 FLIGHT WAS OPERATING IN VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS.  NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS ON FILE.  THE LOCAL FLIGHT DEPARTED SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS AIRPORT, AT ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI, AT 0130.

THE PURPOSE OF THE FLIGHT WAS FOR TRAINING USING A FORWARD LOOKING INFRARED (FLIR) SYSTEM.  PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE TRAINING WERE THE DEA PILOT, AND THE MISSOURI STATE POLICE OBSERVER TO OPERATE THE FLIR SYSTEM IN THE HELICOPTER; TWO DEA AGENTS AND ONE MISSOURI STATE POLICEMAN, ON THE GROUND.  THE PRE-ARRANGED PLAN WAS TO HAVE THE TWO DEA AGENTS AND THE POLICEMAN TRAVEL TO A PRE-SELECTED LOCATION BY MOTOR VEHICLE AND THE HELICOPTER TO FOLLOW AND MAINTAIN AN ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 1,500 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL (AGL).  AFTER ARRIVING AT THE LOCATION, THE FLIR OPERATOR WAS TO LOCATE ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS ON THE GROUND AND FOLLOW HIM TO A PRIVATE RESIDENCE WHILE REMAINING AT THE PRE-ARRANGED ALTITUDE. THE OPERATION WAS TO TAKE PLACE UNDER THE COVER OF DARKNESS.  THERE WAS NO PLAN TO LAND THE HELICOPTER AT THE LOCATION.  TWO WAY RADIO COMMUNICATION WAS MAINTAINED BETWEEN THE HELICOPTER AND THE DEA AGENTS ON THE GROUND.

DURING THE NIGHT OF THE OPERATION, ONE LANDING AT AN ATHLETIC FIELD WAS CONDUCTED TO MAKE A REPAIR TO THE FLIR SYSTEM.  THE MISSION WAS ABORTED AT ANOTHER LOCATION WHEN THE FLIR OPERATOR WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE RESIDENCE SELECTED.  A DECISION WAS MADE AT THAT TIME TO PROCEED TO ANOTHER LOCATION.

THE DEA AGENTS AND THE POLICEMAN ARRIVED AT THE PRE-SELECTED LOCATION AT 0344.  THE TWO DEA AGENTS REMAINED AT THE MOTOR VEHICLE.  THE POLICEMAN BEGAN TO APPROACH THE RESIDENCE, WALKING WEST ON A ROAD. BOTH OF THE DEA AGENTS INDICATED IN THEIR STATEMENTS, THAT AS THE POLICEMAN WAS MAKING HIS WAY WEST TOWARD THE RESIDENCE THEY BECAME AWARE THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS DESCENDING.  THE AGENTS OBSERVATIONS OF THE HELICOPTER WERE BASED ON THEIR OBSERVANCE OF THE NAVIGATION LIGHTS ON THE HELICOPTER AND NOISES THEY HEARD DURING THE EVENT. THEY REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER MISSED STRIKING THE POLICEMAN ON THE ROAD BY APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET.  THE HELICOPTER THEN TOUCHED DOWN IN AN OPEN FIELD RINGED BY TREES SOUTH OF THE ROAD WHERE THE POLICEMAN WAS WALKING AND WEST OF WHERE THE AGENTS WERE SITUATED.

THE DEA AGENTS STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS OBSERVED TO TOUCH DOWN ON THE REAR OF THE SKIDS FIRST, FLATTEN OUT, AND SKID FORWARD.  BOTH DEA AGENTS STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER THEN LIFTED OFF AND CONTINUED SOUTH.  ONE DEA AGENT STATED THAT AS THE HELICOPTER BEGAN TO GAIN ALTITUDE, HE HEARD A NOISE WHICH HE BELIEVED TO BE THE MAIN ROTOR HITTING SOMETHING.  THE DEA AGENTS THEN OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER CONTINUE SOUTH APPROXIMATELY 50 TO 75 YARDS AND GAIN ABOUT 50 FEET OF ALTITUDE.  THEY STATED THE HELICOPTER INITIATED AN ABRUPT RIGHT TURN AND THE NOISE OF THE MAIN ROTOR HITTING TREES BECAME EVIDENT.  THEY STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER THEN ROLLED INVERTED AND IMPACTED THE TERRAIN.  AT NO TIME DID THE WITNESSES OBSERVE THE LANDING LIGHT TO BE ILLUMINATED ON THE HELICOPTER, NOR WERE THERE ANY RADIO TRANSMISSIONS HEARD FROM THE HELICOPTER.

A RADAR PLOT OF THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER'S FLIGHT PATH, JUST PRIOR TO IMPACT, INDICATED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS MAINTAINING BETWEEN 1,200 AND 1,300 FEET MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL), IN THE AREA OF THE IMPACT SITE, COINCIDENT WITH THE APPROXIMATE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.  A COPY OF THE RECORDED RADAR STUDY COMPILED BY THE NTSB, OFFICE OF RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING IS ATTACHED AS AN ADDENDUM TO THIS REPORT.

ON NOVEMBER 27, 1999, ABOUT 1445 CENTRAL STANDARD TIME, A BELL 212, N8144M, REGISTERED TO HOUSTON HELICOPTERS, INC., CRASHED NEAR PHILADELPHIA, MISSISSIPPI, WHILE ON A TITLE 14 CFR PART 91 POSITIONING FLIGHT. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT THE TIME AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED. THE HELICOPTER WAS DESTROYED AND THE AIRLINE TRANSPORT-RATED PILOT AND ONE PASSENGER WERE FATALLY INJURED. THE FLIGHT LAST DEPARTED TUSCALOOSA, ALABAMA, THE SAME DAY, ABOUT 1408.

THE HELICOPTER WAS BEING POSITIONED FROM VIRGINIA, TO PEARLAND, TEXAS, THE HOME BASE FOR THE HELICOPTER OPERATOR. TRANSCRIPT OF COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE FAA AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER, TUSCALOOSA, ALABAMA, SHOW THE FLIGHT ARRIVED AT TUSCALOOSA AT 1329. THE LINEMAN AT DIXIE AIR, INC., TUSCALOOSA, ALABAMA, WHO FUELED THE HELICOPTER, STATED HE TALKED WITH THE PILOT AND PASSENGER WHEN THEY ARRIVED. THEY STATED THEY WERE FLYING TO TEXAS, AND HAD BEEN FLYING SINCE EARLY THAT MORNING. THEY STATED THAT SOMETIME THAT MORNING, THE GREENHOUSE WINDOW ABOVE THE PILOT HAD BROKEN. THEY THEN REQUESTED THAT THE FUEL TANKS BE COMPLETELY TOPPED OFF WITH JET-A FUEL. THE LINEMAN STATED THAT WHEN HE WENT TO THE HELICOPTER TO FUEL IT, HE OBSERVED THAT THE GREENHOUSE WINDOW WAS CRACKED LENGTHWISE. TRANSCRIPTS SHOW THAT AT 1408, THE PILOT REQUESTED AND WAS GIVEN A WEST DEPARTURE FROM TUSCALOOSA. NO FURTHER CONTACT WITH AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL FACILITIES WERE MADE AFTER THIS. (SEE TRANSCRIPT OF COMMUNICATIONS AND WITNESS STATEMENT).

THE TRANSCRIPT OF COMMUNICATIONS RECORDED ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER SHOWED THAT ABOUT 29 MINUTES BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, THE PASSENGER STATED TO THE PILOT ""I THINK IF I HADN'T-A BROKE THAT OFF WE WOULDN'T HAD ANY GREENHOUSE BY THE TIME WE GOT HOME"". ABOUT 18 MINUTES BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, THE PASSENGER STATED TO THE PILOT ""BOY THOSE CATFISH ARE GOING CRAZY DOWN THERE AREN'T THEY"". THE PILOT RESPOND ""YEP"", ""MUST HAVE BEEN THE VIBRATIONS FROM THE HELICOPTER"". ABOUT 2 MINUTES LATER THE PASSENGER AND PILOT DISCUSS SIGHTING DEER IN A FIELD. ABOUT 1 MINUTE 30 SECONDS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, THE PILOT ASKED THE PASSENGER ""HAS THIS VERTICAL JUST GOTTEN IN HERE OR HAS IT BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE?"" THE PASSENGER REPLIED ""WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY VERTICALS AT ALL."" THE PILOT REPLIED, ""WE DO NOW."" THE PASSENGER REPLIED, ""YEAH WELL IT STARTED RIGHT AFTER WE LEFT BACK THERE. I THINK IT MAYBE AH THAT'S WHY I WAS THINKING IT WAS THE AIR."" ABOUT 20 SECONDS LATER, THE PASSENGER STATED THAT ANOTHER PERSON HAD TRACKED THE HELICOPTER'S BLADES BEFORE THEY LEFT AND THAT HE WAS COMMENTING ON HOW SMOOTH IT WAS. ABOUT 40 SECONDS LATER THE PILOT STATED ""THIS STUFF IS GETTING WORSE."" THE RECORDING THEN ENDED. (SEE NTSB COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER FACTUAL REPORT OF GROUP CHAIRMAN).

WITNESSES IN THE AREA OF THE ACCIDENT SITE STATED THAT THEY OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER FLYING FROM EAST TO WEST, JUST ABOVE THE TREETOPS. THE HELICOPTER BEGAN ROLLING BACK AND FORTH. THEY THEN OBSERVED THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES CONTACT THE TAIL AREA, AND THE AFT TAIL BOOM AND TAIL ROTOR SEPARATE. SHORTLY AFTER THIS, THE MAIN ROTOR SEPARATED AND THE HELICOPTER DESCENDED AND CRASHED TO THE GROUND.  A FIRE ERUPTED DURING GROUND IMPACT.

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

THE KEY FIELD AIRPORT, MERIDIAN, MISSISSIPPI, 1453 SURFACE WEATHER OBSERVATION WAS, SKY CLEAR, VISIBILITY 10 MILES, TEMPERATURE 19 DEGREES CENTIGRADE, DEW POINT TEMPERATURE MINUS 1 DEGREE CENTIGRADE, WIND FROM 240 DEGREES AT 3 KNOTS, ALTIMETER 30.16 INCHES HG. KEY FIELD IS LOCATED 30 NM SOUTHEAST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE.

A REVIEW OF THE WEATHER IN THE AREA OF THE ACCIDENT WAS PERFORMED BY THE NTSB, OPERATIONAL FACTORS DIVISION, WASHINGTON, D.C.  THE REVIEW SHOWED THAT THE WINDS IN THE AREA OF THE ACCIDENT WERE LIGHT AND VARIABLE AND THAT THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER DID NOT ENCOUNTER ANY TURBULENCE. (SEE NTSB, OPERATION FACTORS DIVISION REPORT).

COMMUNICATIONS

THE PILOT WAS NOT IN RADIO CONTACT WITH ANY FAA AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL FACILITY AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. THE TRANSCRIPT OF COMMUNICATIONS RECORDED ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER SHOWED THAT THE PILOT HAD THE RADIO FREQUENCY FOR THE FAA JACKSON APPROACH CONTROL, JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI, SET IN THE RADIO. TRANSMISSIONS FROM FLIGHTS APPROACHING JACKSON WERE RECORDED. ONE OF THESE FLIGHTS WAS DELTA AIRLINES FLIGHT 1411. THE LAST TRANSMISSION RECORDED FROM DELTA 1411 WAS ABOUT 11 MINUTES BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, WHEN THE PILOT RESPONDED TO HIS CLEARANCE TO LAND ON RUNWAY 6 LEFT AT JACKSON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.

THE NTSB REQUESTED FROM THE FAA JACKSON APPROACH CONTROL, A TRANSCRIPT OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE APPROACH FREQUENCY AROUND THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. WHEN THE TRANSCRIPT WAS RECEIVED, IT WAS DETERMINED THE WRONG TIME FRAME HAD BEEN TRANSCRIBED. WHEN THE APPROACH CONTROL PERSONNEL WENT BACK TO TRANSCRIBE THE CORRECT TIME FRAME, THEY LEARNED THE RECORDING TAPE HAD BEEN REUSED AND THE RECORDING WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE. DELTA AIRLINES REPORTED TO THE NTSB THAT FLIGHT 1411 ARRIVED AT THE GATE AT JACKSON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT ABOUT 1440. 

FLIGHT RECORDERS

THE HELICOPTER WAS EQUIPPED WITH A UNIVERSAL AVIONICS CVR30 SOLID-STATE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER (CVR). THE CVR WAS RECOVERED FROM THE ACCIDENT SCENE AND TAKEN TO THE NTSB VEHICLE RECORDERS LABORATORY, WASHINGTON, D.C. THE CIRCUIT BOARD CONTAINING THE MEMORY DEVICES IN THE CVR WAS DAMAGED. NTSB LABORATORY PERSONNEL TOOK THE CIRCUIT BOARD TO THE CVR MANUFACTURERS FACILITIES. THE MEMORY DEVICES WERE REMOVED FROM THE DAMAGED CIRCUIT BOARD AND INSTALLED ON A NEW BOARD. THE RECORDED AUDIO DATA FROM THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WAS THEN RECOVERED AND TRANSCRIBED. (SEE NTSB COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER FACTUAL REPORT).

THE NTSB VEHICLE RECORDERS LABORATORY ALSO PERFORMED A SOUND SPECTRUM STUDY ON THE RECORDED AUDIO DATA FROM THE CVR. THE STUDY ATTEMPTED TO IDENTIFY ANY SOUNDS ON THE RECORDING ASSOCIATED WITH THE HELICOPTERS SYSTEMS AND ENGINES. SIGNALS THAT COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER HYDRAULIC PUMP, LOWER PLANETARY GEAR, AND THE OIL COOLER FAN WERE IDENTIFIED. THE SIGNALS EQUATED TO EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS OPERATING AT ABOUT 98 PERCENT OF MAXIMUM SPEED. (SEE NTSB SOUND SPECTRUM STUDY).

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER CRASHED IN A FIELD LOCATED NORTH OF HIGHWAY 16 AND EAST OF HIGHWAY 491, NEAR PHILADELPHIA, MISSISSIPPI. THE HELICOPTER'S MAIN WRECKAGE WAS LOCATED AT COORDINATES 32 DEGREES 47.06 MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE AND 88 DEGREES 55.57 MINUTES WEST LATITUDE. THE CRASH SITE ELEVATION WAS ABOUT 500 FEET MSL. 

WRECKAGE OF THE HELICOPTER WAS FOUND ALONG A 1400-FOOT DEBRIS PATH THAT WAS ORIENTED ALONG A COURSE TO THE SOUTHWEST, ABOUT 233 DEGREES MAGNETIC.  THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS NEARLY LEVEL AND CONTAINED NUMEROUS SMALL-DIAMETER PINE TREES.  A POST-CRASH FIRE CONSUMED A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE FORWARD FUSELAGE AS WELL AS FORWARD PORTION OF THE TAIL BOOM.   

BEGINNING THE WRECKAGE EXAMINATION AT THE FRONT OF THE HELICOPTER, THE FORWARD FUSELAGE, INCLUDING PILOT COMPARTMENT, WAS SUBSTANTIALLY CONSUMED BY FIRE.  THE PILOT SEATS WERE BURNED-AWAY, EXCEPT FOR THE SEAT FRAMES.  THE MAIN CABIN WAS ALSO CONSUMED BY FIRE.  AN ASSEMBLY COMPRISING THE ENGINES, ENGINE MOUNTS, AND ATTACHED PORTION OF AIRFRAME WAS FOUND RESTING ON ITS RIGHT SIDE; IT SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL FIRE DAMAGE.  THE FORWARD SECTION OF TAIL BOOM WAS EXTENSIVELY DAMAGED BY FIRE, INCLUDING THE TAIL BOOM-TO-MAIN FUSELAGE ATTACH POINTS, BACK THROUGH THE TAIL BOOM STRUCTURE TO A POINT AFT OF THE SYNCHRONIZED ELEVATOR.  THE AFT PORTION OF THE TAIL BOOM WAS SEPARATED FROM THE FORWARD SECTION BY MEANS OF A DIAGONAL FRACTURE THAT EVIDENCED A MAIN ROTOR BLADE STRIKE.

THE MAIN TRANSMISSION, MAIN ROTOR BLADES, AFT PORTION OF THE TAIL BOOM, TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX, TAIL ROTOR BLADES, AND PORTIONS OF THE WINDSHIELD EVIDENCED SEPARATION FROM THE HELICOPTER IN FLIGHT, AND WERE DISTRIBUTED ALONG A DEBRIS PATH EXTENDING BACK ON THE ROUTE OF FLIGHT TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  THESE COMPONENTS DID NOT EXHIBIT ANY FIRE DAMAGE, AND SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF SOOTING, HEAT DISCOLORATION, OR STAINING.  THE MAIN TRANSMISSION WAS INTEGRAL UP TO AND INCLUDING THE MAIN ROTOR MAST.  THE MAIN ROTOR WAS SEPARATED FROM THE MAST.  THE MAST EXHIBITED AN OVAL FRACTURE FACE AND EVIDENCED MAIN ROTOR HEAD TO MAST IMPACT PRIOR TO SEPARATION.  THE MAIN TRANSMISSION WAS LOCATED ABOUT 300 FEET NORTHEAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE; THE AFT PORTION OF THE TAIL BOOM WAS FOUND ABOUT 450 FEET EAST-NORTHEAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE; AND THE MAIN ROTOR HEAD AND ATTACHED MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE FOUND ABOUT 1,200 FEET EAST-NORTHEAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  FRAGMENTS FROM THE UPPER WINDSHIELD OR ""GREENHOUSE"" WERE FOUND IN A WIDE AREA THAT BEGAN ABOUT 1,400 FEET NORTHEAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.

THE ENTIRE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM WAS ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE WRECKAGE, EXCEPT FOR THE PITCH CHANGE HORN FOR THE ""RED"" MAIN ROTOR BLADE AND THE MAJORITY OF THE PITCH CHANGE LINK THAT ATTACHES TO THE ""RED"" PITCH CHANGE HORN AT THE PITCH CHANGE LINKS LOWER ROD END.  THE ""RED"" PITCH CHANGE LINKS UPPER ROD END WAS FOUND IN THE WRECKAGE, STILL ATTACHED TO THE MIXING LEVER WITHIN THE STABILIZER BAR ASSEMBLY.  IT EXHIBITED A FRACTURE SURFACE. 

THE ""RED"" GRIP REMAINED IN PLACE IN THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM.  THE SURFACE OF THE ""RED"" GRIP EXHIBITED TWO BOREHOLES THAT MATED WITH TWO BUSHING THAT WERE PART OF THE DEPARTED AND MISSING ""RED"" PITCH CHANGE HORN.  THE MATING GRIP SURFACE EXHIBITED A BLACKISH RESIDUE NEAR THE PITCH CHANGE HORN BOREHOLES, AND THE BLACKISH AREA EXTENDED BEYOND THE BOREHOLES.

THE CRASHSITE AND AN EXTENDED AREA BACK-UP THE WRECKAGE PATH WERE SEARCHED EXTENSIVELY, INCLUDING BY BOY SCOUT PARTIES; THE ""RED"" PITCH CHANGE HORN AND MOST OF THE ""RED"" PITCH CHANGE LINK WERE NOT FOUND.     

PREIMPACT CONTINUITY OF THE FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM WAS NOT ESTABLISHED.  THERE WERE SEPARATIONS IN THE SYSTEM AND POST-CRASH FIRE CONSUMED THE MAJORITY OF FLIGHT CONTROLS IN THE COCKPIT AREA.  FLIGHT CONTROL CONTINUITY WAS ESTABLISHED BEGINNING AT THE DIAGONAL FRACTURE SEPARATING THE AFT TAIL BOOM, BACK THROUGH THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX BELLCRANK, IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE SEPARATED TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX. THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX OUTPUT SHAFT WAS RECOVERED AND FOUND FRACTURED ON BOTH ENDS.

THE MAIN ROTOR CONTROL SYSTEM WAS EXAMINED FROM THE TRANSMISSION MOUNTS UP THROUGH THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES.  THE SYSTEM WAS IMPACT-DAMAGED AND FRACTURED IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS.  THE CONTROLS COULD NOT BE MANIPULATED BECAUSE OF NUMEROUS SEPARATIONS.  AS NOTED ABOVE, THE GRIP FOR THE COLOR-CODED RED MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS RECOVERED IN THE WRECKAGE, BUT THE MATING ""RED"" PITCH CHANGE HORN AND MOST OF THE ATTACHED ""RED"" PITCH CHANGE LINK WERE NOT FOUND. THE FACE OF THE ""RED"" GRIP (WHERE IT HAD BEEN JOINED WITH AND PRESSED AGAINST THE MATING SURFACE OF THE ""RED"" PITCH CHANGE HORN, BY MEANS OF TWO STEEL BUSHINGS THAT WERE PART OF THE PITCH CHANGE HORN ASSEMBLY) WAS FOUND UNEVENLY DISCOLORED AND THE PAINT/PRIMER ON THE FACE OF THE ""RED"" GRIP WERE BLACKENED. THE ""WHITE"" PITCH CHANGE HORN WAS FOUND SEPARATED FROM THE ""WHITE"" GRIP AND THE ""WHITE"" PITCH CHANGE HORN AND MAIN ROTOR GRIP WERE BOTH RECOVERED IN THE WRECKAGE. THE GRIP TO PITCH CHANGE HORN MATING SURFACE ON THE ""WHITE"" GRIP DID NOT HAVE THE BLACK-IN-COLOR RESIDUE THAT WAS FOUND ON THE ""RED"" GRIP.     

THE AFT PORTION OF THE TAIL BOOM WAS EXAMINED FOR FAILURES AND MALFUNCTIONS.  THE AFT PORTION WAS FRACTURED DIAGONALLY FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, SEPARATING THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT.  THE VERTICAL STABILIZER WAS INTEGRAL TO THE AFT PORTION OF THE TAIL BOOM.  THE 42-DEGREE AND 90-DEGREE GEARBOXES WERE IN","AT THE LAST REFUELING STOP THE PILOT AND PASSENGER STATED TO THE LINEMAN THAT THE GREENHOUSE WINDOW ABOVE THE PILOT HAD CRACKED DURING THE PREVIOUS LEG OF THE FLIGHT. THE TRANSCRIPT OF COMMUNICATIONS RECORDED ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER SHOWED THAT ABOUT 29 MINUTES BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, THE PASSENGER STATED TO THE PILOT ""I THINK IF I HADN'T-A BROKE THAT OFF WE WOULDN'T HAD ANY GREENHOUSE BY THE TIME WE GOT HOME"". ABOUT 18 MINUTES BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, THE PASSENGER STATED TO THE PILOT ""BOY THOSE CATFISH ARE GOING CRAZY DOWN THERE AREN'T THEY"". THE PILOT RESPOND ""YEP"", ""MUST HAVE BEEN THE VIBRATIONS FROM THE HELICOPTER"". ABOUT 2 MINUTES LATER THE PASSENGER AND PILOT DISCUSS SIGHTING DEER IN A FIELD.

ABOUT 40 SECONDS LATER THE PILOT STATED ""THIS STUFF IS GETTING WORSE."" THE RECORDING THEN ENDED. WITNESSES IN THE AREA OF THE ACCIDENT SITE STATED THAT THEY OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER FLYING FROM EAST TO WEST, JUST ABOVE THE TREETOPS. THE HELICOPTER BEGAN ROLLING BACK AND FORTH. THEY THEN OBSERVED THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES CONTACT THE TAIL AREA, AND THE AFT TAIL BOOM AND TAIL ROTOR SEPARATE. SHORTLY AFTER THIS, THE MAIN ROTOR SEPARATED AND THE HELICOPTER DESCENDED AND CRASHED TO THE GROUND.  A FIRE ERUPTED DURING GROUND IMPACT. WITNESSES DID NOT OBSERVE ANY SMOKE COME FROM THE HELICOPTER PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. THE ENTIRE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM WAS ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE WRECKAGE, EXCEPT FOR THE PITCH CHANGE HORN FOR THE ""RED"" MAIN ROTOR BLADE AND THE MAJORITY OF THE PITCH CHANGE LINK THAT ATTACHES TO THE ""RED"" PITCH CHANGE HORN AT THE PITCH CHANGE LINKS LOWER ROD END. THE ""RED"" GRIP REMAINED IN PLACE IN THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM.  THE SURFACE OF THE ""RED"" GRIP EXHIBITED TWO BOREHOLES THAT MATED WITH TWO BUSHING THAT WERE PART OF THE DEPARTED AND MISSING ""RED"" PITCH CHANGE HORN.  THE MATING GRIP SURFACE EXHIBITED A BLACKISH RESIDUE NEAR THE PITCH CHANGE HORN BOREHOLES, AND THE BLACKISH AREA EXTENDED BEYOND THE BOREHOLES. THE CRASHSITE AND AN EXTENDED AREA BACK-UP THE WRECKAGE PATH WERE SEARCHED EXTENSIVELY, INCLUDING BY BOY SCOUT PARTIES; THE ""RED"" PITCH CHANGE HORN AND MOST OF THE ""RED"" PITCH CHANGE LINK WERE NOT FOUND. EXAMINATION OF THE RED GRIP BY AN NTSB METALLURGIST SHOWED THE SURFACES OF BOTH THE UPPER AND LOWER HOLES SHOWED EXTENSIVE AREAS OF DARK DEPOSITS AND SURFACE DAMAGE CONSISTENT WITH REPEATED SMALL RELATIVE MOVEMENTS AGAINST MATING OBJECTS  (FRETTING).  VISIBLE FRETTING AREAS COVERED MOST OF THE SURFACE OF THE BUSHING COUNTER BORES AND PORTIONS OF THE FRACTURED SURFACES OF THE THREADS. ENERGY DISPERSIVE X-RAY ANALYSIS OF SAMPLES OF THE BLACK DEPOSITS TAKEN FROM THE UPPER HOLE FOUND THEM TO MOSTLY CONTAIN ALUMINUM AND IRON AND SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF OXYGEN ALONG WITH MINOR AMOUNTS FOR THE OTHER CONSTITUENTS OF THE GRIP AND BUSHING. SAMPLES FROM THE LOWER HOLE WERE FOUND TO BE MOSTLY ALUMINUM WITH LARGE PEAKS FOR IRON, CADMIUM, SILICON AND OXYGEN.  BOTH BUSHING COUNTER BORES SHOWED LOCALIZED MATERIAL REMOVAL AND ENLARGEMENT OF THE DIAMETERS. UP TO  .020 TO 0.025 INCHES OF MATERIAL WERE REMOVED IN LOCALIZED AREAS FROM THE BUSHING BORE. IN ADDITION, THE BORES WERE DEFORMED AND DISTORTED ADJACENT TO THE GRIP SURFACE. THE SURFACES OF THE HOLES, PARTICULARLY THE UPPER ONE, ALSO CONTAINED CIRCUMFERENTIAL MARKS IN THE BUSHING COUNTER BORE, THE LOCK RING DIAMETER AND ON THE FRACTURED THREADS INDICATING PROGRESSIVE AND INCREMENTAL MOVEMENT OF THE MATING OBJECTS. NO OTHER EVIDENCE OF FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OF THE HELICOPTER STRUCTURE, FLIGHT CONTROLS, ENGINE, OR ROTOR AND ROTOR DRIVE SYSTEM WAS FOUND. AIRCRAFT RECORDS SHOW THE ROTOR HEAD, INCLUDING THE""RED"" BLADE GRIP AND PITCH CHANGE HORN, WAS LAST REMOVED FROM THE HELICOPTER IN MARCH 1998, 162.2 FLIGHT HOURS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, FOR BLADE RETENTION STRAP REPLACEMENT.","THE FAILURE OF THE PILOT AND COMPANY MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL DURING PREFLIGHT AND PERIODIC INSPECTIONS TO IDENTIFY THE SIGNS OF FRETTING AND LOOSENESS IN THE ""RED"" MAIN ROTOR BLADE PITCH CHANGE HORN TO MAIN ROTOR BLADE GRIP ATTACHMENT, RESULTING IN THE HELICOPTER CONTINUING IN SERVICE WITH A LOOSE PITCH CHANGE HORN, SEPARATION OF THE PITCH CHANGE HORN FROM THE BLADE GRIP, AND INFLIGHT BREAKUP OF THE HELICOPTER DUE TO THE MAIN ROTOR STRIKING THE TAILBOOM. CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO RESPOND TO INCREASED VIBRATION IN THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM AND LAND IMMEDIATELY."

ON MARCH 19, 2000, AT 1545 PACIFIC STANDARD TIME, A BELL 212 HELICOPTER, N415B, WAS DESTROYED AFTER IMPACTING TERRAIN FOLLOWING A LOSS OF CONTROL WHILE IN CRUISE FLIGHT NEAR SNELLING, CALIFORNIA.  THE COMMERCIAL PILOT, WHO WAS THE SOLE OCCUPANT, RECEIVED FATAL INJURIES.  THE AIRCRAFT WAS BEING OPERATED AS A POSITIONING FLIGHT BY AVIATION INTERNATIONAL ROTORS (A.I.R.), INC., APPLE VALLEY, CALIFORNIA, UNDER 14 CFR PART 91 WHEN THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED.  THE FLIGHT ORIGINATED FROM FRESNO, CALIFORNIA, AT 1515, AND WAS DESTINED FOR SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT THE TIME AND A COMPANY VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR) FLIGHT PLAN HAD BEEN FILED.

THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WAS SECOND IN A FLIGHT OF TWO EN ROUTE TO SACRAMENTO.  BOTH HELICOPTERS DEPARTED APPLE VALLEY, MADE FUEL STOPS IN BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA, AND FRESNO BEFORE CONTINUING ON TO THEIR FINAL DESTINATION OF SACRAMENTO.  THE LEAD PILOT REPORTED THAT THEY WERE CRUISING ABOUT 800 FEET MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL), OR 400 TO 500 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL (AGL), OVER ROLLING TERRAIN.  THE PILOT ESTIMATED THAT THE ACCIDENT AIRCRAFT WAS ECHELON RIGHT, AND ABOUT EIGHT ROTOR DISKS TO THE REAR, WITH CRUISE AIRSPEED OF ABOUT 100 KNOTS.  BOTH AIRCRAFT WERE ON A COMMON AIR-TO-AIR FREQUENCY AND HAD BEEN COMMUNICATING PREVIOUSLY WITH NO REPORTED DIFFICULTIES.  

AS THE FLIGHT NEARED THE SNELLING HIGHWAY NORTHEAST OF MERCED, THE LEAD PILOT CALLED THE ACCIDENT PILOT, ASKING ABOUT HIS FUEL CONSUMPTION RATE.  WHEN HE DID NOT RECEIVE A REPLY, HE TURNED HIS HELICOPTER 180 DEGREES TO LOOK FOR THE OTHER HELICOPTER.  AS HE DID, HE SAW A COLUMN OF BLACK SMOKE.  HE FLEW TOWARD THE SMOKE, AND AS HE NEARED, HE REALIZED THE SECOND HELICOPTER HAD CRASHED AND WAS NEARLY ENGULFED WITH FLAMES.  

HE IMMEDIATELY LANDED HIS HELICOPTER, DEPLANED, AND APPROACHED THE BURNING WRECKAGE TO AID THE PILOT, BUT WAS DRIVEN BACK BY THE HEAT AND FLAMES.  REALIZING THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FURTHER HE COULD DO, HE GOT BACK INTO HIS HELICOPTER AND FLEW TO CASTLE AIRPORT (LOCATED IN ATWATER, CALIFORNIA, APPROXIMATELY 11 MILES SOUTHWEST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE), WHERE HE REPORTED THE ACCIDENT TO AUTHORITIES AND THE OPERATOR.

THE LEAD PILOT REPORTED HE HAD AN ENCOUNTER WITH A LARGE BIRD ABOUT A MILE BACK ALONG THE FLIGHT PATH FROM THE ACCIDENT SITE.

PERSONNEL INFORMATION

THE NON-INSTRUMENT RATED COMMERCIAL HELICOPTER PILOT HAD ACCUMULATED 6,200 TOTAL FLIGHT HOURS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY 500 HOURS WERE IN THE SAME MAKE AND MODEL AS THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER.  HE OBTAINED A SECOND-CLASS MEDICAL CERTIFICATE, WHICH WAS ISSUED ON MAY 11, 1999, WITH A LIMITATION FOR CORRECTIVE LENSES, AND A WAIVER FOR BLOOD PRESSURE.  

THE PILOT UNDERWENT SURGERY IN DECEMBER 1999, TO ADJUST FOR FLAT FEET.  AS A RESULT OF THE SURGERY, THE PILOT WORE A CAST ON HIS RIGHT LOWER LEG THAT EXTENDED FROM JUST BELOW HIS KNEE TO HIS TOES.

THE PILOT DID NOT FLY AFTER THE SURGERY UNTIL THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT.  HE RECEIVED A CHECK-OUT FLIGHT FROM THE PILOT OF THE LEAD HELICOPTER BEFORE THEY DEPARTED ON THEIR TRIP.  THE PURPOSE OF THE FLIGHT WAS TO SEE IF THE CAST WOULD INHIBIT THE PILOT'S ABILITY TO FLY THE HELICOPTER.  ACCORDING TO THE CHIEF PILOT, BOTH THE LEAD AND ACCIDENT PILOTS DETERMINED THAT THE ACCIDENT PILOT WOULD BE ABLE TO FLY. 

ACCORDING TO THE LEAD PILOT, THE ACCIDENT PILOT WAS MENTALLY READY AND EXCITED TO FLY.  THE ACCIDENT PILOT ASSURED THE LEAD PILOT THAT HIS PERSONAL DOCTOR HAD RELEASED HIM TO WORK AND HE WAS READY TO FLY.  THE CHECK-OUT FLIGHT LASTED LESS THAN 30 MINUTES AND INCLUDED OPERATIONS IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN.  HE REPORTED NOTING NO PROBLEMS WITH THE ACCIDENT PILOT'S ABILITY TO FLY THE HELICOPTER.  

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

THE TWIN-ENGINE HELICOPTER (SERIAL NUMBER 30613) WAS POWERED BY TWO PRATT & WHITNEY PT-6-3 ENGINES.  THE HELICOPTER'S MAIN ROTOR GROUP INCLUDED A TWO-BLADE, SEMI-RIGID TYPE ROTOR, AND A STABILIZER BAR WITH DAMPERS.  THE ROTOR HUB YOKE WAS UNDERSLUNG ON ITS MOUNTING TRUNNION THROUGH TWO PILLOW BLOCKS, WHICH PROVIDED A FLAPPING AXIS.  THE ALL METAL BLADES WERE ATTACHED THROUGH GRIPS, WHICH ROTATED ON YOKE SPINDLES TO CHANGE BLADE PITCH.  THE HELICOPTER'S PAINT SCHEME (FROM THE SKID CROSSOVER TUBES TO THE TRANSMISSION/ENGINE AREA) CONSISTED OF HORIZONTAL BANDS OF RED, BLUE, WHITE, BLUE, AND WHITE.  

REVIEW OF HELICOPTER MAINTENANCE RECORDS REVEALED THAT THE HELICOPTER UNDERWENT ITS LAST ANNUAL INSPECTION ON MARCH 15, 2000, AT AN AIRFRAME TOTAL TIME OF 15,184.8 HOURS.  ACCORDING TO THE MAINTENANCE LOG, THE FOLLOWING WORK WAS CONDUCTED DURING THE ANNUAL INSPECTION:

INSPECTION OF HANGAR ASSEMBLIES
OVERHAUL OF TAIL ROTOR HUB ASSEMBLY
OVERHAUL MAIN DRIVE SHAFT
OVERHAUL PYLON ASSEMBLY
MAIN ROTOR HEAD STRAP CHANGE
OVERHAUL MAIN TRANSMISSION

AT THE TIME OF THE ANNUAL INSPECTION, ONE OF THE TWO BLADES (THE WHITE BLADE, P/N 212015501-115, S/N A-2991) WAS REMOVED FOR REWORK AND REPAIR.  THE TOTAL TIME ON THE BLADE SINCE MANUFACTURE WAS 1,861 HOURS.  THE HISTORICAL SERVICE RECORD FOR THE BLADE INDICATED THAT ON DECEMBER 20, 1999, IT UNDERWENT THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS: ""INSPECTED I.A.W. [IN ACCORDANCE WITH] 204-099-223 VOL. XI, REPAIRED THE LOWER SURFACE SKIN AT STATION 70 TO 74.5 PER IAC-8110-0386, REPAIRED THE UPPER AND LOWER SURFACES SPAR DOUBLERS AT THE TIP, INSTALLED A FULL CHORD SKIN REPAIR ON THE UPPER AND LOWER SURFACE AT THE TIP, REPLACED THE ABRASION STRIP, REPLACED THE INBOARD LEADING EDGE SPLICE COVER, REPLACED THE FORWARD TIP CAP, REPLACED THE MAIN ATTACHMENT BUSHING, REFINISHED THE PAINT AND STATIC BALANCED PER BHT [BELL HELICOPTER TEXTRON] SPEC[IFICATIONS].""  THE BLADE HAD ACCUMULATED 8.3 HOURS AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT SINCE ITS REINSTALLATION.

A MECHANIC FLEW WITH THE ACCIDENT PILOT ON THE APPLE VALLEY TO BAKERSFIELD, AND BAKERSFIELD TO FRESNO LEGS OF THE FLIGHT.  ACCORDING TO THE MECHANIC'S WRITTEN STATEMENT, HE PERFORMED THE DAILY PREFLIGHT INSPECTIONS ALONG WITH THE PILOT ON THE MORNING OF THE ACCIDENT.  THE PILOT REQUESTED APPROXIMATELY 2 CUPS OF OIL IN THE COMBINED GEARBOX, TO WHICH THE MECHANIC COMPLIED AND ADDED THE OIL.  THE MECHANIC REPORTED THEY DEPARTED FOR THE FIRST LEG OF FLIGHT AND DURING THE TAKEOFF CLIMB, THE ACCIDENT PILOT RADIOED THE LEAD PILOT ALERTING HIM OF A TORQUE SPLIT OF APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT.  THE LEAD PILOT ASKED IF THE ACCIDENT PILOT HAD VERIFIED THE NUMBER 2 THROTTLE WAS ""FULL OPEN WITH FRICTION?""  THE ACCIDENT PILOT RESPONDED THAT HE WOULD VERIFY.  THE MECHANIC ADDED THE LEAD PILOT WAS CORRECT AND THE ENGINE TORQUE INDICATIONS WERE THEN ""MATCHED PERFECTLY,"" AND THEY CONTINUED TO BAKERSFIELD.  THE MECHANIC REPORTED THE REMAINDER OF THE FLIGHT TO BAKERSFIELD, AND THE FLIGHT TO FRESNO, WERE UNEVENTFUL, AND THE PILOT FLEW ""PERFECTLY.""

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

ACCORDING TO THE LEAD PILOT, THE WEATHER AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WAS DESCRIBED AS UNLIMITED VISIBILITY, WITH CLEAR SKIES, AND WIND FROM 330 DEGREES AT 20 KNOTS GUSTING TO 30 KNOTS.  

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

MERCED COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES REPORTED WHEN RESCUE PERSONNEL REACHED THE SCENE, ABOUT 2 HOURS AFTER THE CRASH, THE FIRE HAD BURNED ITSELF OUT.  THE DEBRIS PATH EXTENDED ALONG THE APPROXIMATE ROUTE OF FLIGHT ON A BEARING OF ABOUT 300 DEGREES COVERING A DISTANCE OF NEARLY 1,000 FEET.  THE MAIN WRECKAGE CAME TO REST AT 37 DEGREES 29.182 MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE AND 120 DEGREES 21.038 WEST LONGITUDE.  

ONE OF THE FIRST PIECES OF DEBRIS FOUND WAS A NEARLY 12-FOOT SECTION OF THE HONEYCOMB AIRFOIL FROM THE WHITE BLADE.  ITS SEPARATION FROM THE BLADE BEGAN OUTBOARD OF THE DOUBLERS, RAN ALONG THE LEADING EDGE D-SPAR, AND CONTINUED TO WITHIN ABOUT 2 FEET OF THE TIP.  THE SKIN ON THE SEPARATED UPPER SURFACE OF THE BLADE WAS ROLLED BACK TOWARD THE TRAILING EDGE.  THE OUTBOARD 2 FEET OF BLADE, EXCLUDING THE LEADING EDGE SPAR, WAS LOCATED FURTHER ALONG THE DEBRIS PATH, BUT FORWARD OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.

THE LEFT SKID AND LEFT STEP, WITH A CORRESPONDING GROUND SCAR WERE FOUND EARLY IN THE DEBRIS FIELD (APPROXIMATELY 456 FEET PRIOR TO THE MAIN WRECKAGE AREA), AS WERE SECTIONS OF THE LEFT CABIN AND PILOT DOORS, AND A SECTION OF THE NOSE COMPARTMENT ACCESS DOOR (BATTERY DOOR).

THE MAIN ROTOR HUB, WITH THE REMAINING PORTION OF BOTH BLADES, WAS FOUND ABOUT 400 FEET BEYOND THE MAIN WRECKAGE, AND WAS THE LAST ITEM FOUND IN THE DEBRIS FIELD.    

FUSELAGE

THE MAIN FUSELAGE SHOWED EVIDENCE OF MULTIPLE SEPARATIONS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT THAT BEGAN NEAR THE NOSE, RAN THROUGH THE FLOOR, EXTENDING AFT TO THE ENGINE COWLINGS.  THE FUSELAGE SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF SLIDING AFTER GROUND CONTACT.  THE MAJORITY OF THE FUSELAGE STRUCTURE SUSTAINED SEVERE FIRE DAMAGE.  THE ENTIRE COCKPIT AND CABIN SURROUNDING STRUCTURE WAS DESTROYED.  THE INSTRUMENT PANEL, AND THE LEFT AND RIGHT SEAT WERE IN PLACE; HOWEVER, THE LEFT SEAT SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL DEFORMATION IN THE DOWN DIRECTION.  THE LEFT SIDE COLLECTIVE AND CYCLIC CONTROLS WERE DESTROYED.  THE RIGHT SEAT REMAINED INTACT; HOWEVER, THE SEAT CUSHION AND COVER WERE DESTROYED BY THE FIRE.  THE RIGHT SEAT CYCLIC AND COLLECTIVE CONTROLS WERE IN PLACE; HOWEVER, THE TOP PORTION OF THE CYCLIC CONTROL WAS SEPARATED AND BURNED.  THE INSTRUMENT PANEL SUSTAINED DEFORMATION AND HEAT DAMAGE.  THE COMPLETE RIGHT WINDSCREEN WAS FOUND ON THE GROUND JUST FORWARD OF THE MAIN FUSELAGE.  NO EVIDENCE OF THE LEFT WINDSCREEN WAS FOUND.

THE UNDERLYING TRANSMISSION AND ENGINE SUPPORT AREA WAS COMPRESSED AND BURNED TO WHERE THE TRANSMISSION WAS FOUND LAYING ON THE GROUND ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE WRECKAGE AND THE CONTROL DECK AND ENGINES WERE APPROXIMATELY WASTE HIGH.   

THE NOSE COMPARTMENT ACCESS DOOR WAS FOUND SEPARATED INTO TWO SECTIONS.  THE ONE SECTION DISPLAYED SOME SOOTING AND THE OTHER SECTION, WHICH WAS FOUND EARLY IN THE DEBRIS PATH, WAS CLEAN.  THE FRACTURE SURFACE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN CUT IN A DIAGONAL DIRECTION FROM MID-LENGTH ON THE RIGHT SIDE (WHEN VIEWED FROM THE AFT OF THE HELICOPTER) TO MID-LENGTH ON THE LEADING EDGE OF THE DOOR.  

THE RADAR DOME COVER WAS ALSO FOUND SEPARATED FROM THE AIRCRAFT AND WAS FOUND ALONG THE DEBRIS PATH.

THE PILOT WAS FOUND SEATED IN THE LEFT FRONT SEAT.  HE WAS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN WEARING A FLIGHT HELMET, WHICH THE OPERATOR REPORTED THAT HE ROUTINELY DID NOT BUCKLE.  THE HELMET WAS FOUND OUTSIDE THE LEFT SIDE OF THE MAIN FUSELAGE AND THERE WAS NO APPARENT DAMAGE.

THE PILOT'S HELMET AND A SECTION OF THE LEFT DOOR POST WERE RETAINED BY THE SAFETY BOARD  FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION CONCERNING MATTER FOUND ON THE DOOR AND HELMET.  

MAIN ROTOR HUB AND BLADES

EXAMINATION OF THE ROTOR BLADES AND HUB REVEALED THE MAIN ROTOR HUB REMAINED INTACT.  THE ENTIRE RED BLADE AND THE WHITE BLADE'S LEADING EDGE REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE ROTOR HUB.  THE WHITE BLADE DRAG BRACE REMAINED IN ONE PIECE AND WAS ATTACHED TO A SECTION OF BLADE TRAILING EDGE.  THE RED BLADE DRAG BRACE WAS BENT AND SEPARATED TOWARD THE BLADE'S LEADING EDGE (AS THOUGH THE DRAG BRACED ENDS HAD BEEN BENT TOWARD EACH OTHER IN THE AFT DIRECTION).  THE STABILIZER BAR WAS FRAGMENTED AND A MAJORITY OF ITS COMPONENTS WERE FOUND NEAR THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES.  THE SEPARATION SURFACES RESEMBLED TAFFY IN THEIR DEFORMATION.  

THE RED BLADE SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL CHORDWISE DAMAGE FROM THE ROOT TO APPROXIMATELY MIDSPAN.  THE BLADE REMAINED INTACT; HOWEVER, SOME OF THE CHORDWISE GOUGING DESTROYED THE BLADE SKIN AND UNDERLYING HONEYCOMB.  THE OUTBOARD TIP OF THE BLADE DISPLAYED SOME LIGHT SCORING AND WHITE PAINT TRANSFERS.   

THE SAFETY BOARD RETAINED THE WHITE MAIN ROTOR BLADE FRAGMENTS FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION.

MAIN ROTOR CONTROLS AND MAST

THE MAIN ROTOR MAST WAS SEPARATED INTO TWO SECTIONS; THE LOWER SECTION, WHICH STAYED WITH THE MAIN WRECKAGE AND ITS TRANSMISSION, AND THE UPPER SECTION, WHICH WAS SEPARATED AT THE BLADE STOP AREA AND WAS CONNECTED TO THE MAIN ROTOR HUB.  THE MAST SEPARATION AREA SHOWED EVIDENCE OF RECTANGULAR DISTORTION TOWARD THE INSIDE DIAMETER OF THE MAST, DIRECTLY BELOW THE BLADE STOPS.  THE MAST FRACTURE SURFACES DISPLAYED 45-DEGREE SHEAR LIPS.  

TAIL BOOM AND TAIL ROTOR

ALTHOUGH NEARLY BURNED TO ASH, THE TAIL BOOM REMAINED IN ITS POSITION RELATIVE TO THE FUSELAGE.  THE TAIL STINGER DID NOT DISPLAY ANY BENDING OR SCRAPING.  THE TAIL ROTOR SHOWED EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANT LEADING EDGE CONTACT ON ONE BLADE.  A LINEAR GROUND SCAR EQUIVALENT IN LENGTH TO A TAIL ROTOR BLADE WAS OBSERVED ADJACENT TO THE TAIL ROTOR SECTION.  SEVERAL SECTIONS OF TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT, WHICH WERE FOUND ADJACENT TO THE MAIN WRECKAGE AREA, SHOWED EVIDENCE OF TORSIONAL TWISTING AND SEPARATION.  THE TAIL BOOM, FORWARD OF THE 42-DEGREE GEARBOX, WAS DESTROYED BY THE FIRE.  THE ELEVATOR SPAR TUBE AND HORN ASSEMBLY WERE FOUND IN THEIR RELATIVE POSITION AMONG THE TAIL BOOM ASH; HOWEVER, THE ELEVATOR SKINS WERE BURNED TO ASH ENTIRELY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A 1-FOOT OUTBOARD SECTION OF THE LEFT ELEVATOR.  IT WAS ALSO FOUND AMONG THE DEBRIS FIELD AND WAS UNBURNED.  THE FRACTURE SURFACE OF THE 1-FOOT ELEVATOR SECTION DISPLAYED CURVED METAL IN THE UPWARD DIRECTION ON THE UPPER AND LOWER SKIN, AND THE SPAR TUBE.   

ENGINE

THE ENGINES WERE EXAMINED AT THE SALVAGE FACILITY BY A TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE OF PRATT & WHITNEY AND THE SAFETY BOARD.   NO ANOMALIES WITH THE ENGINES WERE NOTED THAT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THEIR OPERATION. 

HYDRAULIC SYSTEM 

THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL HEAT DAMAGE AND WAS DESTROYED. 

TESTS AND RESEARCH

THE DOORPOST AND HELMET WERE SENT TO THE ARMED FORCES INSTITUTE OF PATHOLOGY (AFIP) IN WASHINGTON, D.C., IN AN ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE IF A BIRD HAD CONTACTED EITHER THE HELMET OR DOORPOST.  ACCORDING TO AFIP, THE DOORPOST AND HELMET WERE RETURNED TO THE WRECKAGE STORAGE FACILITY AND A REPORT WAS SENT TO THE SAFETY BOARD; HOWEVER, THE SAFETY BOARD HAS NO RECORD OF RECEIPT OF THE AFIP REPORT.  

THE FRACTURED WHITE BLADE WAS EXAMINED BY THE SAFETY BOARD METALLURGY LAB AND BELL HELICOPTER METALLURGISTS.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT BLADE STATIONS (MEASUREMENT OF INCHES) ARE REFERENCED IN BOTH REPORTS.  THE BELL HELICOPTER REPORT REFERENCES BLADE STATIONS FROM THE CENTER OF THE HUB (BEING ZERO) TO THE TIP OF THE BLADE (BEING 288).  THE SAFETY BOARD REPORT REFERENCES BLADE STATIONS FROM THE ROOT OF THE BLADE (BEING ZERO) TO THE TIP OF THE BLADE (BEING 264).  

ACCORDING TO THE REPORT PRODUCED BY BELL HELICOPTER METALLURGISTS, APPROXIMATELY 97 PERCENT OF THE BLADE WAS RECOVERED FOR EXAMINATION.  THE LEADING EDGE SPAR WAS IN ONE PIECE AND HAD REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE ROTOR HUB AT THE ACCIDENT SITE.  THE SPAR WAS BENT DOWNWARD AND WAS SWEPT FORWARD.  THE LEADING EDGE SPAR DISPLAYED IMPACT DAMAGE AT STATIONS 78-110, 181-183, AND 281-283.5.    

A 152.5-INCH SECTION OF HONEYCOMB, SKIN, AND TRAILING EDGE AFTER-BODY BETWEEN BLADE STATIONS 111.5 AND 264, WAS FOUND SEPARATED FROM THE SPAR.  THIS SECTION WAS FOUND EARLY IN THE WRECKAGE DISTRIBUTION PATH.  ""ALL OF THE SKIN FRACTURES ON THE TOP OF THE BLADE WERE ADJACENT TO THE SPAR'S AFT END.""  THE SKIN FRACTURES ON THE BOTTOM SIDE OF THE BLADE WERE EITHER ADJACENT TO OR AS MUCH AS 3 INCHES FROM THE SPAR'S AFT END.  ALL OF THE FRACTURES OF THAT SECTION ""WERE A RESULT OF OVERLOAD.""

THE SEPARATIONS OF THE TOP SKIN FROM THE SPAR BETWEEN STATIONS 160 AND 178.5, AND BETWEEN STATIONS 263 AND 279, WERE EXAMINED.  THE SEPARATED SURFACES OF THE SPAR AND SKIN EXHIBITED ""FRACTURED ADHESIVE WITH A ROUGH TEXTURE TO THE SEPARATED SURFACES INDICATING BOTH SEPARATED IN A COHESIVE MANNER AS A RESULT OF OVERLOAD.""

BOTH THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE BLADE EXHIBITED SPANWISE STREAKS OF PAINT THAT WERE TRANSFERRED FROM OTHER PARTS, AS WELL AS ASSOCIATED MECHANICAL DAMAGE.  RED AND WHITE PAINTS WERE THE MAIN PAINT COLORS TRANSFERRED.  THE LEADING EDGE ABRASION STRIP, WHICH REMAINED WITH THE SPAR, HAD SCORE MARKS AS WELL AS SMEARS OF RED, WHITE, AND YELLOW COLORED PAINT.  THE SMEARS WERE SPANWISE IN THE OUTBOARD DIRECTION.

THERE WAS HEAVY CHORDWISE DAMAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SKIN AND THE TRAILING EDGE OF THE BLADE FROM IMPACT WITH AN OBJECT.  ONE OF THE STRIKES WAS AT STATION 264.  THE BOTTOM SKIN AND HONEYCOMB, AS WELL AS THE TRAILING EDGE AND TRIM TAB STRUCTURE WERE TORN AND FRACTURED DUE TO THE IMPACT.  THE CONTOUR OF THE BROKEN TRAILING EDGE HAD A MEASURED DIAMETER OF APPROXIMATELY 1.25 INCHE","THE TWIN-ENGINE HELICOPTER IMPACTED TERRAIN FOLLOWING A MAST BUMPING EVENT AND SUBSEQUENT THE LOSS OF CONTROL.  THE HELICOPTER WAS THE SECOND IN A FLIGHT OF TWO AND TRAILED THE LEAD HELICOPTER BY A SHORT DISTANCE.  THE LEAD PILOT NOTICED THE SECOND HELICOPTER WRECKAGE AFTER THE PILOT DID NOT RECEIVE A RADIO RESPONSE FROM THE ACCIDENT PILOT; HE REPORTED RECEIVING NO DISTRESS TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE ACCIDENT PILOT.  THE FIRST HELICOPTER PILOT REPORTED THEY WERE IN CRUISE FLIGHT BETWEEN 400 - 500 FEET AGL AT 100 KNOTS.  HE SAID THAT HE ENCOUNTERED A LARGE BIRD ABOUT 1 MILE BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.   A 12-FOOT SECTION OF ONE OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WAS FOUND EARLY ON IN THE WRECKAGE DEBRIS PATH, WHICH EQUALED APPROXIMATELY 1,000 FEET IN LENGTH AND WAS ORIENTED ALONG THE FLIGHT'S COURSE.  CUT PORTIONS OF THE LEFT SKID, BATTERY DOOR, AND THE LEFT ELEVATOR WERE FOUND EARLY ON IN THE DEBRIS PATH.  THE SEPARATED MAIN ROTOR BLADE UNDERWENT AN OVERHAUL APPROXIMATELY 8.3 HOURS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.  THE MAIN ROTOR MAST DISPLAYED EVIDENCE OF A MAST BUMPING EVENT, WITH INDENTATIONS CORRESPONDING TO THE BLADE STOPS.  THE MAST SEPARATED AT THE BLADE STOP AREA.  THE COMMERCIAL HELICOPTER PILOT WAS WEARING A CAST ON HIS RIGHT LEG, WHICH EXTENDED FROM BELOW HIS KNEES TO HIS TOES.  THE PILOT RECEIVED A CHECK-OUT FLIGHT AFTER NOT FLYING FOR 3 MONTHS.  ACCORDING TO THE PILOT WHO PROVIDED THE CHECK-OUT FLIGHT, THE ACCIDENT PILOT PERFORMED A FEW TRAFFIC PATTERN OPERATIONS AND WAS FOUND TO BE ABLE TO FLY.  A MECHANIC WHO FLEW WITH THE ACCIDENT PILOT DURING THE FIRST LEGS OF THE FLIGHT INDICATED THE PILOT WAS ABLE TO FLY WITH NO PROBLEMS.  THOUGH THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF A MAST BUMPING EVENT, THE INITIATING EVENT IS UNKNOWN.  EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE DISCLOSED NO ANOMALIES THAT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED NORMAL SYSTEM OPERATION AND THE ENGINES DISPLAYED EVIDENCE OF ROTATION AT THE TIME OF GROUND IMPACT.  THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE WITH THE SEPARATED SECTION WAS EXAMINED AND IT WAS NOTED THAT ITS FAILURE WAS A RESULT OF OVERLOAD SEPARATION AND DID NOT DELAMINATE IN FLIGHT.",THE IN-FLIGHT SEPARATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR MAST WHILE IN CRUISE FLIGHT FOLLOWING A MAST BUMPING EVENT.  THE REASON FOR THE MAST BUMPING EVENT WAS NOT DETERMINED.

ON APRIL 2, 2000, APPROXIMATELY 1150 PACIFIC DAYLIGHT TIME, A BELL 47G-3B-1 HELICOPTER, N3377H, REGISTERED TO AND BEING OPERATED BY A COMMERCIAL PILOT, WAS DESTROYED WHEN IT STRUCK A FENCE AND TERRAIN FOLLOWING A ROTOR RPM LOSS WHILE IN CRUISE APPROXIMATELY THREE NAUTICAL MILES SOUTHEAST OF STANWOOD, WASHINGTON.  THE PILOT, OCCUPYING THE LEFT SEAT, SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES.  THE CENTER PASSENGER SUSTAINED SERIOUS INJURIES AND HER HUSBAND, OCCUPYING THE RIGHT SEAT, SUSTAINED FATAL INJURIES.  A POST-CRASH FIRE CONSUMED A PORTION OF THE HELICOPTER.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AND NO FLIGHT PLAN HAD BEEN FILED.  THE TRIP WAS A SIGHTSEEING FLIGHT WHICH WAS TO HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED WITHIN 25 NAUTICAL MILES OF THE DEPARTURE AIRPORT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH 14 CFR 135.1(A)(5).  THE FLIGHT DEPARTED ARLINGTON, WASHINGTON, APPROXIMATELY 1105 AFTER PICKING UP THE TWO PASSENGERS.

THE PILOT WAS TELEPHONICALLY INTERVIEWED ON APRIL 3, 2000, AND REPORTED THAT AFTER DEPARTING ARLINGTON AND FLYING TOWARDS THE COAST AND THEN NORTH TO THE MOUTH OF THE STILLAGUAMISH RIVER HE TURNED INLAND TO FOLLOW THE RIVER (REFER TO CHART I PROVIDED BY THE PILOT).  HE REPORTED THAT HE WAS FLYING ABOUT 60-70 MPH.  SHORTLY AFTER CROSSING THE BRIDGE (REFER TO CHART II) HE HEARD A LITTLE ""CLUNK"" SOUND AND THEN THE ENGINE STARTED TO RACE (RPM INCREASED ABOVE WHAT HE NORMALLY SAW FOR THIS TYPE OF FLIGHT REGIME).  THERE WAS NO VIBRATION, COUGHING, SPUTTERING OR OTHER ENGINE INDICATIONS.  AS THE ENGINE RPM INCREASED THE (MAIN) ROTOR RPM BEGAN TO DECAY. THIS ALL OCCURRED IN A VERY SHORT TIME (2 SECONDS). HE MANEUVERED THE HELICOPTER TOWARD A FIELD ALONG THE NORTH SIDE OF THE RIVER AND NEVER SAW THE ELECTRIC FENCE.  HE REPORTED THAT HE LANDED HARD IN A LITTLE RIGHT ROLL AND THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST ON ITS RIGHT SIDE.

PERSONNEL INFORMATION

THE PILOT HELD A COMMERCIAL CERTIFICATE AND REPORTED A TOTAL OF 5,777 HOURS OF FLIGHT EXPERIENCE, OF WHICH 1,187 WERE IN THE BELL 47 ROTORCRAFT.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

AIRFRAME AND ENGINE LOGBOOKS, AS WELL AS A COMPUTER PRINTOUT PROVIDED BY THE PILOT/OWNER FOR N3377H'S TRIP LOG, WERE REVIEWED.  THE ROTORCRAFT WAS EQUIPPED WITH A LYCOMING O-435-25A ENGINE (THE MILITARY EQUIVALENT OF THE TVO-435-B1A), A 270 HORSEPOWER ENGINE.  THE ENGINE WAS INSTALLED IN N3377H ON MARCH 2, 2000, HAVING BEEN PREVIOUSLY REMOVED FROM ANOTHER BELL 47 ROTORCRAFT ON MARCH 10, 1993, AT A TOTAL TIME SINCE LAST MAJOR OVERHAUL (TSMOH) OF 507.8 HOURS, (REFER TO ATTACHMENT EL-I).  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE WITHIN THE LOGBOOK THAT THE ENGINE HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN ANY ROTORCRAFT OR OPERATED DURING THE TIME INTERVAL BETWEEN MARCH 10, 1993, AND MARCH 2, 2000.

THE OVERHAUL HAD BEEN SIGNED OFF ON DECEMBER 17, 1984.  THE TOTAL ENGINE TIME (TSMOH) ON THE DAY BEFORE THE ACCIDENT WAS 540.0 HOURS (32.2 HOURS SINCE INSTALLATION).  THE LAST INSPECTION CONDUCTED ON N3377H WAS LOGGED AS AN ""ANNUAL"" ON APRIL 2, 1999.  THE TOTAL AIRFRAME TIME AT THAT TIME WAS RECORDED AS 6,471.8 HOURS (REFER TO ATTACHMENT AF-I), HOWEVER, THE TRIP LOG SHOWED 6,468.2 HOURS ON THE SAME DATE.  THE FOLLOWING (AND FINAL) AIRFRAME LOG ENTRY WAS THE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED ENGINE INSTALLATION AND NO TOTAL AIRFRAME TIME WAS RECORDED.  THE TRIP LOG SHOWED A TOTAL TIME OF 6,568.2 HOURS ON APRIL 2, 2000.

THE LYCOMING AIRCRAFT ENGINE ASSEMBLY PARTS LIST MANUAL CONTAINED A DIAGRAM OF THE CRANKSHAFT FOR THE TVO-435-B1A ENGINE SHOWING THE INSTALLATION OF AN ""OIL JET"" (REFER TO ATTACHMENT LYC-I).  THE JET, WHICH WAS A 1/8-27 NATIONAL PIPE THREAD (NPT) STANDARD FITTING, WAS A THREADED PLUG (HOLLOW BOLT) WITH A SMALL ORIFICE DRILLED THOROUGH THE BOLT CAP DESIGNED TO ALLOW OIL TO PASS OUT OF THE END OF THE CRANKSHAFT AND UP INTO THE TRANSMISSION SO AS TO PROVIDE LUBRICATION TO THE LOWER MAST BEARING.  THE ORIFICE WAS NOT GREATER THAN 0.025 INCH IN DIAMETER.  WITH THE JET NOT SCREWED IN PLACE WITHIN ITS THREADED INSERT, A GREATER AMOUNT OF OIL WOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO FLOW INTO THE TRANSMISSION AND CLUTCH CHAMBER FROM THE 3/8 INCH INSIDE DIAMETER THREADED HOLE AT THE END OF THE CRANKSHAFT.  THE OVERHAUL MANUAL - AVCO LYCOMING VERTICAL HELICOPTER ENGINES STATED ON PAGE 9-14:

""9-85.  OIL JET OR PIPE PLUG.  INSTALL EITHER THE OIL JET OR PIPE PLUG IN THE THREADED OPENING IN THE FRONT CRANKSHAFT OIL PLUG AND TIGHTEN TO SPECIFIED TORQUE.  SEE FIGURE 9-18."" (REFER TO ATTACHMENT OM-I).

THE JET WAS TO HAVE BEEN TORQUED TO A MINIMUM OF 40 INCH-POUNDS, AS SHOWN IN THE LYCOMING SERVICE TABLE OF LIMITS (REFER TO ATTACHMENT LYC-II).

REFER TO DIAGRAM A-A WHICH IS A COPY OF THE AIRSPEED VERSUS ALTITUDE CHART TAKEN FROM THE FLIGHT MANUAL OF THE BELL 47G-3B-1 ROTORCRAFT. 

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

ON-SITE EXAMINATION WAS CONDUCTED BY AN INSPECTOR FROM THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION'S (FAA) RENTON FLIGHT STANDARDS DISTRICT OFFICE.  THE ROTORCRAFT WAS OBSERVED TO HAVE COME TO REST IN A FLAT, GREEN, GRASSY FIELD A SHORT DISTANCE NORTH OF THE EAST/WEST ORIENTED STILLAGUAMISH RIVER (REFER TO CHART II).  TWO SETS OF ELECTRIC FENCING, SEPARATED BY AN APPROXIMATE 10 FOOT WIDE TRACTOR PATH, WERE OBSERVED TO RUN EAST/WEST JUST NORTH OF THE RIVER.  THE SOUTHERNMOST FENCE CONSISTED OF METAL STAKES PAINTED GREEN WITH AN APPROXIMATE EIGHT INCH WHITE SECTION AT THE TOP OF EACH STAKE.  TWO STRANDS OF UN-INSULATED WIRE WERE ATTACHED TO THE FENCE AND THE TOP WIRE WAS OBSERVED TO BE BROKEN.  THE NORTHERNMOST FENCE CONSISTED OF RUST COLORED STAKES AND THE TOPS OF THIS FENCE WAS APPROXIMATELY TWO FEET HIGHER THAN THE FORMER FENCE DUE TO A GENERAL UPSLOPE IN THE TERRAIN TOWARD THE NORTH.  TWO STRANDS OF UN-INSULATED WIRE WERE ATTACHED TO THE FENCE AND BOTH WIRES WERE OBSERVED TO BE BROKEN.  ONE OF THE WIRES WAS OBSERVED ENTANGLED IN ONE OF THE HELICOPTER'S SKIDS AT ITS FINAL RESTING PLACE.

THE ROTORCRAFT WAS OBSERVED APPROXIMATELY 65 FEET NORTH-NORTHEAST OF THE INITIAL GROUND IMPACT MARKS LOCATED AT THE NORTHERN EDGE OF THE NORTHERNMOST ELECTRIC FENCE (REFER TO PHOTOGRAPH 1).  THE AIRCRAFT WAS OBSERVED AT REST ON ITS RIGHT SIDE AND ALL MAJOR COMPONENTS WERE LOCATED AT THE FINAL RESTING PLACE OR WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE THEREOF (REFER TO PHOTOGRAPH 2).  A POST-CRASH FIRE HAD DESTROYED THE COCKPIT/CABIN AREA, INCLUDING THE COCKPIT INSTRUMENTATION.

FIRE

THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE OBSERVED A SMALL FUEL-FED POST-CRASH FIRE UNDER THE RIGHT SADDLE TANK ABOUT 15 SECONDS AFTER THE AIRCRAFT CAME TO REST.  THE OCCUPANTS WERE ALL REMOVED FROM THE AIRCRAFT BEFORE THEY SUSTAINED ANY FIRE INJURY.

TESTS AND RESEARCH

POST-CRASH EXAMINATION AND DISASSEMBLY OF THE TRANSMISSION REVEALED THAT THE OIL JET (HOLLOW BOLT) WHICH SCREWS INTO THE FORWARD END OF THE ENGINE CRANKSHAFT WAS NOT WITHIN ITS THREADED HOLE.  THE THREADED OIL JET WAS OBSERVED LYING LOOSE WITHIN THE CAVITY FORWARD OF THE CRANKSHAFT (REFER TO PHOTOGRAPH 3).  EXAMINATION OF THE OIL JET REVEALED RANDOM MECHANICAL DAMAGE TO THE BOLT'S THREADS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE BOLT HAVING VIBRATED/BOUNCED AROUND WITHIN THE CAVITY.  THE OVERALL APPEARANCE OF THE THREADS WAS CLEAN AND UNWORN.  THE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY WAS EXAMINED AND DIMENSIONALLY CHECKED WITH NO DISCREPANCIES NOTED.  THE CLUTCH PADS WERE CHECKED FOR THICKNESS AND FOUND TO BE WITHIN ACCEPTABLE TOLERANCES AND WITHOUT EXCESSIVE WEAR (REFER TO PHOTOGRAPH 4).  THE PADS DISPLAYED THEIR DIAGONAL GROOVING AND A SLIGHT SATIN-LIKE SHEEN (REFER TO PHOTOGRAPH 5).  ADDITIONALLY, THE PADS AS WELL AS THE INTERIOR OF THE CLUTCH HOUSING HAD A MODERATE COATING OF OIL ON THEIR SURFACES (REFER TO PHOTOGRAPH 6).

POST-CRASH EXAMINATION REVEALED NO OTHER ANOMALIES WITHIN THE TRANSMISSION ASSEMBLY.  THE ENGINE WAS EXAMINED WITH CONTINUITY OF THE CRANKSHAFT, CAMSHAFT AND ACCESSORY DRIVE GEARS BEING VERIFIED.  THE ENGINE OIL FILTER WAS CLEAR OF PARTICULATES AND DEBRIS, AND COMPRESSION ON ALL SIX CYLINDERS WAS ESTABLISHED DURING MANUAL ROTATION OF THE CRANKSHAFT.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ON-SITE EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE WAS CONDUCTED ON APRIL 2, 2000, AFTER WHICH THE WRECKAGE WAS MOVED TO THE ARLINGTON AIRPORT AND SECURED.  POST-CRASH EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE WAS CONDUCTED APRIL 11, 2000, AND THE WRECKAGE WAS THEN RELEASED TO MR. JIM STIGER, REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY (REFER TO NTSB FORM 6120.15 ENCLOSED).","THE PILOT AND TWO PASSENGERS WERE ENGAGED IN A SIGHTSEEING FLIGHT EASTBOUND OVER A RIVER IN THE BELL 47G HELICOPTER WHEN THEY HEARD A 'CLUNK,' THE ENGINE BEGAN TO OVERSPEED, AND ROTOR RPM BEGAN TO DECAY.  THE PILOT EXECUTED AN AUTOROTATION TO A NEARBY FIELD.  JUST PRIOR TO TOUCHDOWN, THE HELICOPTER SNAGGED THE WIRES OF TWO LOW PROFILE, FOUR-FOOT HIGH ELECTRICAL FENCES WHICH HE DID NOT SEE.  THE HELICOPTER THEN ROLLED/YAWED TO THE RIGHT AND MADE A HARD LANDING, COMING TO REST ON ITS RIGHT SIDE.  POST-CRASH EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION REVEALED NO MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS.  HOWEVER, THE OIL JET (A THREADED, HOLLOW PLUG WHICH SCREWED INTO THE FORWARD END OF THE ENGINE CRANKSHAFT) WAS FOUND LYING LOOSE BENEATH THE CLUTCH HOUSING.  THE INTERIOR SURFACES OF THE CLUTCH HOUSING DISPLAYED A LARGE AMOUNT OF OIL.  THE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY WAS FOUND TO BE WITHOUT MECHANICAL DISPARITIES AND WITHIN NORMAL WEAR LIMITS.  THE RELEASE OF THE OIL JET WOULD HAVE ALLOWED ENGINE OIL TO FLOW THROUGH THE 3/8 INCH THREADED ORIFICE INTO THE LOWER TRANSMISSION AND CLUTCH HOUSING AT A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATE THAN THROUGH THE SMALL DIAMETER ORIFICE IN THE END OF THE OIL JET, RESULTING IN DISENGAGEMENT OF THE CLUTCH.  THE ORIFICE IN THE JET WAS INTENDED TO ALLOW A MIST OR LIGHT SPRAY OF OIL TO REACH THE LOWER MAST BEARING FOR LUBRICATION PURPOSES.","THE DISENGAGEMENT OF THE OIL JET FITTING FROM ITS THREADED RECEPTACLE AT THE FORWARD END OF THE ENGINE CRANKSHAFT. THIS RESULTED IN EXCESSIVE OIL WITHIN THE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY, THE SUBSEQUENT SLIPPING OF THE CLUTCH, AND ULTIMATELY THE DISENGAGEMENT OF THE ROTOR DRIVE SYSTEM FROM THE ENGINE. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE THE PILOT'S NOT MAINTAINING CLEARANCE FROM THE ELECTRIC FENCES WHICH WERE ALSO HIDDEN OBJECTS AGAINST THE GRASS LANDING SURFACE."

THE PREVIOUS PROJECT PILOT STATED THAT ""WHEN YOU LIVE WITH, AND FLY FOR A GEOPHYSICAL SEISMIC CREW FOR 3 OR 4 WEEKS, THEY GET USED TO YOU; A NEW GUY HAS TO PROVE HIMSELF.""  THE OPERATOR STATED THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE PILOT HAD BEEN ON ASSIGNMENT IN THE UNITED STATES.

ON MAY 3, 2000, THE PILOT FLEW HIS FIRST DAY AS THE PROJECT PILOT.  IN THE AFTERNOON, THE SAFETY OFFICER OF THE GEOPHYSICAL PROJECT SAID THAT THE PILOT TOLD HIM THAT THIS WAS ""HIS FIRST TIME TO FLY IN THE DESERT, AND THE [DESERT'S UNPREDICTABLE] WINDS.""  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE PILOT SEEMED ""VERY BRASH.""

ON MAY 4, 2000, THE HELICOPTER MECHANIC SAID THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS FUELED AT THE LZ1 STAGING AREA (LANDING ZONE 1; N37 DEGREES 22.77', W109 DEGREES 28.40'; ELEVATION 4,702 FEET) TO ITS PROJECT MAXIMUM 40 PERCENT OF THE 143 GALLON TANK, OR 57 GALLONS.  A GEOPHYSICAL TEAM MEMBER, WHO OPERATED THE KODIAK SYSTEM [A COMPUTERIZED GROUND BASED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT DISPLAYS AND RECORDS THE REAL-TIME HELICOPTER LOCATION UTILIZING GPS TECHNOLOGY] AT THE STAGING AREA, SAID THAT HE BRIEFED THE PILOT FOR THE FLIGHT.  HE SAID THAT THE BRIEFING INCLUDED A REQUEST THAT THE PILOT ""FLY A LITTLE EASIER; LESS AGGRESSIVE.""  THE KODIAK OPERATOR TOLD THE PILOT THAT TWO OTHER TEAM MEMBERS HAD SPOKEN TO HIM AND REQUESTED THAT HE TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS ""ROUGH HANDLING OF THE HELICOPTER.""   

THE HELICOPTER DEPARTED AT 1545 AND FLEW 5.35 NAUTICAL MILES (NM) DIRECT TO LZ4 (N37 DEGREES 20.56', W109 DEGREES 23.01'; ELEVATION 4,586 FEET) TO PICK UP FIVE GEOPHYSICAL TEAM MEMBERS.  THE HELICOPTER'S FLIGHT DATA STOPPED RECORDING ON THE KODIAK, AT 1547, DUE TO THE TERRAIN MASKING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE LINE-OF-SIGHT SYSTEM.

THE PASSENGER SITTING IN THE LEFT FRONT SEAT SAID THAT WHEN HE BOARDED THE HELICOPTER AT LZ4, THE PILOT WAS WEARING A FLIGHT HELMET AND SHOULDER HARNESS.  BECAUSE OF THE ANTICIPATED SHORT RIDE, THE PASSENGER SECURED HIMSELF WITH ONLY THE SEAT BELT; HE ALSO PUT ON A HEADSET.  AT 1552, THE KODIAK SYSTEM ONCE AGAIN STARTED RECORDING; THE HELICOPTER WAS RECORDED FLYING WESTBOUND.  THE ESTIMATED WEIGHT OF THE HELICOPTER, WITH FIVE PASSENGERS AND EQUIPMENT, WAS 4,076 POUNDS.

AT THIS POINT, THE KODIAK OPERATOR SAID THAT HE WAS SCHEDULED TO TRANSMIT THE TEAM'S MULTIPLE DROP OFF POINTS TO THE PILOT.  BUT INSTEAD, HE TRANSMITTED A RADIO REQUEST FOR THE PILOT TO LAND THE HELICOPTER SO THAT A SEISMIC SHOT COULD BE FIRED [THE HELICOPTER'S NOISE/VIBRATION IS PICKED UP BY THE GEOPHONES, AND RECORDED IF THE HELICOPTER IS AIRBORNE AT THE TIME OF THE SHOT].  ACCORDING TO THE KODIAK OPERATOR, THE PILOT RADIOED BACK THAT HE WOULD SET DOWN ""ON TOP, UP HERE"" [ON TOP OF THE MESA].  THE HELICOPTER WAS LAST RECORDED (2.6 NM OF FLIGHT FROM LZ4) ON THE KODIAK AS FLYING 065 DEGREES AT 68 KNOTS, AT AN ALTITUDE OF 1,696 METERS, OR 5,565 FEET.  THIS WOULD HAVE PLACED HIM 199 FEET ABOVE THE MESA (ELEVATION 5,366 FEET).

THE SAFETY OFFICER, LOCATED .74 NM EAST OF THE CRASH SITE, OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER FLYING EASTBOUND TOWARDS HIM (THIS PORTION OF THE FLIGHT WAS NOT RECORDED ON THE KODIAK DUE TO TERRAIN BLOCKING).  HE SAID THAT AS IT APPROACHED THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE MESA, IT MADE A ""VERY HARD LEFT HAND TURN [180 DEGREES] BACK TO THE WEST.""  HE LATER ESTIMATED THAT THE HELICOPTER'S BANK WAS 45 TO 60 DEGREES.  HE THEN SAW THE HELICOPTER TURN SOUTHBOUND, LOWER ITS NOSE ALMOST VERTICALLY DOWN, AND THEN REDUCE ITS NOSE LOW PITCH TO APPROXIMATELY 45 DEGREES AS IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.  IMMEDIATELY HE OBSERVED A CLOUD OF DIRT AND DUST.  HE GOT ON THE RADIO AND REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS DOWN; APPROXIMATELY 1 MINUTE FROM THE HELICOPTER'S DISAPPEARANCE, HE OBSERVED SMOKE RISING FROM THE MESA TOP.       

ONE OF THE SURVIVING BACK SEAT PASSENGERS [WHO WAS ON HIS FIRST FLIGHT WITH THE PILOT] SAID THAT HE REMEMBERED A HARD LEFT TURN, FOLLOWED BY A LOUD POP, THEN A SCREAMING WHIR,"" FOLLOWED BY A RED LIGHT ON THE PILOT'S INSTRUMENT PANEL.  ANOTHER SURVIVING PASSENGER SAID THAT HE HEARD A LOUD NOISE (SOUNDED LIKE SOMETHING BREAKING), AND THEN A LOUD BEEP, BEEP, BEEP....  THE THIRD SURVIVING BACK SEAT PASSENGER SAID THAT HE SAW THE PILOT MOVE HIS LEFT HAND QUICKLY TOWARDS SOMETHING NEAR HIS LEFT KNEE.  HE SAID THAT THE PILOT LOOKED ""UPSET,"" AND THEN HE HEARD A LOUD HIGH PITCH SCREAMING SOUND.  THE PASSENGER FURTHER REPORTED THAT MOMENTS LATER THE PILOT PULLED UP (ON THE COLLECTIVE) WITH BOTH HANDS, BUT NOTHING HAPPENED.

PERSONAL INFORMATION

THE PILOT WAS A CANADIAN CITIZEN.  ACCORDING TO THE OPERATOR'S RECORDS, THE PILOT HAD A COMMERCIAL PILOT CERTIFICATE (HELICOPTER) AND PRIVATE PILOT CERTIFICATE (SINGLE ENGINE AIRPLANE).  HE WAS NOT INSTRUMENT RATED.  THE RECORDS FURTHER INDICATED THAT AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, THE PILOT HAD APPROXIMATELY 2,900 HOURS TOTAL TIME IN HELICOPTERS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 1,500 HOURS IN THIS MAKE AND MODEL.  THE RECORDS ALSO INDICATED THAT THE PILOT HAD FLOWN IN A VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING DESERT CONDITIONS IN CANADA.  

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER WAS A SINGLE ENGINE, SIX SEAT AIRCRAFT, WHICH WAS MANUFACTURED BY AEROSPATIALE (NOW EUROCOPTER) IN 1980.  IT WAS POWERED BY AN TURBOMECA ARRIEL-1B TURBO SHAFT ENGINE RATED AT 641 HORSEPOWER AT SEA LEVEL.  THE ENGINE (S/N 303) WAS INSTALLED IN THE AIRCRAFT ON MARCH 14, 2000, WITH A TOTAL TIME ON IT OF 9,274 HOURS.  

ON MARCH 21, 2000, THE ENGINE AIR-INTAKE PARTICLE SEPARATOR WAS REMOVED, WHICH REDUCED THE HELICOPTER'S WEIGHT BY 14.6 POUNDS.  THE LAST WEIGHT AND BALANCE MEASUREMENT WAS PERFORMED ON MARCH 29, 2000; THE HELICOPTER'S EMPTY WEIGHT WAS DETERMINED TO BE 2,624.01 POUNDS.  THE AIRCRAFT'S CERTIFICATED MAXIMUM GROSS WEIGHT WAS 4,300 POUNDS, ITS IN-GROUND-EFFECT (IGE) MAXIMUM GROSS WEIGHT FOR THE WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS 4,025 POUNDS, AND ITS OUT-GROUND-EFFECT (OGE) MAXIMUM GROSS WEIGHT FOR THE WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS 3,725 POUNDS.  TRANSITIONAL LIFT SPEED WAS 15 KNOTS.     

THE PREVIOUS PILOT ASSIGNED TO THE HELICOPTER, DEPARTED EDMONTON, ALBERTA, ON MARCH 31, 2000, IN THE HELICOPTER AND FLEW IT TO THE PROJECT SITE.  HE ARRIVED IN BLANDING ON APRIL 1, 2000; THE TOTAL TRIP FLIGHT TIME WAS APPROXIMATELY 10 HOURS.  HE FLEW FOR THE GEOPHYSICAL PROJECT UNTIL BEING RELIEVED BY THE ACCIDENT PILOT ON MAY 3, 2000.  THE PREVIOUS PILOT STATED THAT HE ""FELT VERY GOOD ABOUT THE AIRCRAFT,"" AND HE HAD VERY FEW PROBLEMS WITH IT.  MAINTENANCE PERFORMED ON THE AIRCRAFT DURING HIS TOUR OF DUTY WAS CONFINED TO A TAIL-ROTOR CHANGE AND AN ENGINE BLEED VALUE CHANGE.  HE SAID THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THE OPERATOR'S ""BETTER AIRCRAFT."" 

THE MAINTENANCE PERSON ASSIGNED TO THE HELICOPTER SAID THAT HE PERFORMED AN ANNUAL INSPECTION ON APRIL 22, 2000.  THE AIRCRAFT RECORDS INDICATED THAT THE LAST DAILY INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED ON MAY 3, 2000; THE MAINTENANCE PERSON SAID AN INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED ON MAY 4, BUT WAS NEVER RECORDED IN THE AIRCRAFT LOGBOOKS.  AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, THE HELICOPTER HAD 11,221 HOURS OF FLIGHT TIME AND THE ENGINE HAD 9,427 HOURS SINCE NEW.

THE HELICOPTER'S FUEL TANK HELD 143 GALLONS, AND WAS CALIBRATED IN PERCENT OF CAPACITY.  THE OPERATOR SAID THAT THE UTAH OPERATION WAS USING A 40 PERCENT OF TANK CAPACITY RULE, OR 57 GALLONS MAXIMUM FUEL (6.7 POUNDS PER GALLON).  A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENGINE MANUFACTURER SAID THAT THE AIRCRAFT BURNED AN AVERAGE 37 GALLONS PER HOUR.  A MANUAL FUEL FLOW CONTROL LEVER (FCL) WAS LOCATED BY THE PILOT'S LEFT KNEE.  THIS WAS USED FOR STARTING THE ENGINE, AND WOULD PERMIT THE PILOT TO MANUALLY CONTROL FUEL FLOW IF THE ENGINE'S FUEL CONTROLLER MALFUNCTIONED.  TO MANUALLY OPERATE THE FCL, THE PILOT WOULD HAVE TO DISENGAGE THE LEVER AND SLOWLY MANIPULATE IT IN THE EMERGENCY SIDE OF THE QUADRANT.  ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER'S REPRESENTATIVE, THE ""MANUAL FCL HAS A SMALL RANGE FOR MOVEMENT, AND IS VERY SENSITIVE TO OPERATE.""     

THE HELICOPTER'S NORMAL MAIN ROTOR SPEED IN FLIGHT WAS 386 RPM.  THE HELICOPTER WAS EQUIPPED WITH A LOW ROTOR HORN, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOUNDED STEADILY IF THE MAIN ROTOR SPEED DECREASED BELOW 360 RPM.  THE HORN WOULD ALSO SOUND ANYTIME THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM PRESSURE FELL BELOW 30 BAR (1 BAR IS EQUAL TO 14.5 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH [PSI]).  THE HELICOPTER WAS ALSO EQUIPPED WITH A MASTER CAUTION PANEL THAT INCLUDED SIX RED WARNING LIGHTS.  THEY WOULD ILLUMINATE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: 1. LOW HYDRAULIC PRESSURE (WHEN MAIN ROTOR BLADE RPM DECREASED BELOW 250); 2. LOW ENGINE OIL PRESSURE (WHEN THE POWER TURBINE SPEED DECREASED BELOW 70%); 3. LOW MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX OIL PRESSURE (WHEN MAIN ROTOR BLADE RPM DECREASED BELOW 200); 4. HIGH MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX OIL TEMPERATURE; 5. ENGINE FIRE WARNING LIGHT; AND 6. HIGH BATTERY TEMPERATURE WARNING LIGHT.   

THE HELICOPTER'S LANDING SKIDS HAD BLACK HARD RUBBER ""BEAR PAWS"" ATTACHED TO THE AFT END OF THE SKIDS, WHICH FACILITATED LANDING IN SNOW OR ON SOFT TERRAIN SURFACES.  THEY MEASURED APPROXIMATELY 18 INCHES BY 12 INCHES.  

THE AIRCRAFT WAS EQUIPPED WITH AN NS500 KODIAK NAVIGATION SYSTEM THAT PROVIDED REAL-TIME INFORMATION ABOUT THE HELICOPTER'S LOCATION (USING GPS), AND WAS USED TO TRANSMIT PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS TO THE PILOT.  THE EQUIPMENT WAS DESIGNED AND BUILT BY EAGLE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS, INC., OF CALGARY, ALBERTA.  THE SYSTEM STORED, AT 10 SECOND INTERVALS, THE FLIGHT DATA OF THE HELICOPTER'S OPERATIONS.  ITS DATA-LINK WAS LIMITED TO LINE-OF-SIGHT OPERATION; A KODIAK REPEATER, LOCATED AT THE SOUTHERN END OF THE PROJECT AREA, EXPANDED THE SYSTEM'S OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES IN THE RUGGED TERRAIN.  WHEN THE HELICOPTER'S LOCATION WAS BLOCKED BY TERRAIN FROM BOTH KODIAK RECEIVERS, THE AIRCRAFT'S LOCATION COULD NOT BE RECORDED, NOR COULD IT RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS.   

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

AT 1553, THE WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE CORTEZ MUNICIPAL AIRPORT (ELEVATION 5,914 FEET), 110 DEGREES 36 NM FROM THE ACCIDENT SITE, WERE AS FOLLOWS: WIND 230 DEGREES AT 8 KNOTS GUSTING TO 16 KNOTS; VISIBILITY 10 STATUTE MILES; CLOUD CONDITION CLEAR; TEMPERATURE 82 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT; DEW POINT 52 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT; ALTIMETER SETTING 30.02 INCHES OF MERCURY.  WITNESSES AT THE ACCIDENT SITE REPORTED THAT THE TEMPERATURE WAS BETWEEN 90 AND 95 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.  THE DENSITY ALTITUDE WAS CALCULATED TO BE 8,908 FEET.  

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST ON AN IRREGULARLY SURFACED ROCKY DESERT MESA (N37 DEGREES 21.71', W109 DEGREES 24.51'; ELEVATION 5,366 FEET; MCCRACKEN MESA) WITH SCATTERED POCKETS OF SOIL.  THE IMPACT SITE WAS SPARSELY VEGETATED WITH CEDARS AND SCRUB BRUSH RANGING UP TO 15 FEET IN HEIGHT.  THE VISIBLE GROUND SCARS AND AIRCRAFT DEBRIS TRAIL WERE LONGITUDINALLY ALIGNED AT 150 DEGREES AND EXTENDED FOR APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET.  THE FUSELAGE AND CABIN AREA WAS FOUND RESTING ON ITS RIGHT SIDE (240 DEGREE ALIGNMENT), AND THE EMPENNAGE WAS FOUND UPRIGHT.  THE THREE FATALLY INJURED OCCUPANTS, THE PILOT IN THE FRONT SEAT AND THE TWO PASSENGERS IN THE BACK SEAT, WERE ALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CABIN AREA.  THE INJURED PASSENGERS WERE ALL SEATED ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HELICOPTER; TWO WERE SEATED IN THE BACK SEAT AND ONE IN THE LEFT FRONT SEAT.       

IN THE FIRST 25 FEET OF VISIBLE DEBRIS, THERE WERE SEVERAL BRUSH AND CEDAR BRANCHES SEPARATED FROM BUSHES; AT 25 FEET, THERE WAS A GROUND SCAR THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH A TAILSKID STRIKE.  AT 34 FEET, THERE WAS A 3 FOOT HIGH ROCK LEDGE (PERPENDICULAR TO THE GROUND SCARS); ON THE TOP OF THE LEDGE THERE WERE SCRAPE MARKS WITH GREEN AND BLACK PAINT TRANSFERS.  APPROXIMATELY 2 FEET IN FRONT OF THE LEDGE AND ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE LEDGE SCARS, WAS A ROCK WITH ADDITIONAL GROUND SCARS.  AT 42 TO 50 FEET, THERE WAS AN 8 TO 10 INCH DEEP GROUND SCAR WITH THE RIGHT LANDING SKID IN IT; APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET FURTHER WAS PLEXIGLAS, AND RUBBER WINDOW AND DOOR SEALS.  PARALLEL TO THIS DEBRIS, APPROXIMATELY 4 FEET TO THE LEFT, WAS ANOTHER 8 FOOT GROUND SCAR (4 TO 6 INCHES DEEP) LEADING TOWARDS THE MAIN FUSELAGE.  AT THE 40 FOOT POINT, A 16 TO 18 FOOT SLAP MARK WAS FOUND (APPROXIMATELY 12 INCHES WIDE) EXTENDING TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DEBRIS FIELD.             

FLIGHT CONTROL CONTINUITY COULD NOT BE DETERMINED DUE TO EXTENSIVE THERMAL DAMAGE.  ALL THREE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE FOUND WITH THE FUSELAGE; ONE BLADE WAS FOUND UNDER A SECTION OF BURNED AND MELTED TAIL BOOM.  ALL THREE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE FRACTURED CHORDWISE NEAR STATION 1,000 (APPROXIMATELY 4 FEET OUTBOARD FROM THE BLADE PINS).  THE TAIL ROTOR BLADES REMAINED ATTACHED; BOTH BLADES EXHIBITED NO APPRECIABLE LEADING EDGE DAMAGE.  ONE TAIL ROTOR BLADE STRIKE TAB HAD NO DAMAGE; THE OTHER WAS BENT APPROXIMATELY 45 DEGREES AFT.  BOTH BLADES EXHIBITED MECHANICAL ABRASION ON THE LEADING EDGE ON THE OUTBOARD 3 TO 4 INCHES OF BLADE.  ONE TAIL ROTOR BLADE CUFF WAS BROKEN; THIS SAME BLADE EXHIBITED IMPACT DAMAGE.  

THE LOWER FIN ON THE VERTICAL STABILIZER, WITH TAILSKID, WAS FOUND CRUSHED BACK AND UP INTO THE VERTICAL STABILIZER.  THE RIGHT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER'S OUTER 40 PERCENT WAS BENT UP APPROXIMATELY 45 DEGREES. 

THE FUSELAGE/CABIN AREAS WERE FOUND DESTROYED BY FIRE.  THE ROTOR BRAKE, ENGINE FUEL FLOW AND EMERGENCY FUEL SHUTOFF WERE FOUND DISCONNECTED FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTROL TUBES.  THE ROTOR BRAKE LEVER WAS FOUND IN THE AFT, OR FULL MAIN ROTOR BLADES BRAKE POSITION.  THE ENGINE FCL WAS FOUND IN THE AFT/FULL OFF POSITION, PLACING IT IN THE POSITION FOR ENGINE SHUTDOWN.  THE EMERGENCY FUEL FLOW SHUTOFF LEVER WAS FOUND IN THE FORWARD POSITION, PLACING IT IN THE NORMAL POSITION FOR OPERATION. 

EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE TO MAIN GEARBOX AND ENGINE TO TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX DRIVE COUPLINGS SHOWED NO SIGNATURES OF TORQUE DEFORMATION.  THE NUMBER ONE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT REMAINED ATTACHED TO PART OF THE LONG SHAFT BY ITS FORWARD SPLINE.  THESE TWO SHAFTS SEPARATED FROM THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE TRAIN, AND WERE FOUND APPROXIMATELY 15 FEET FORWARD OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE DEBRIS.

THE FUEL CONTROL UNIT FCU) THROTTLE POINTER WAS FOUND IN THE EMERGENCY POSITION.  DURING DISASSEMBLY OF THE ENGINE, THE FIRST AND SECOND STAGE TURBINE WHEELS WERE FOUND WITH THEIR BLADES 50 TO 70 PERCENT MELTED.  THE ENGINE MANUFACTURER REPORTED THAT ""THE GENERAL EVIDENCE INDICATES AN ENGINE THAT FUNCTIONED DURING A CERTAIN TIME AT A TEMPERATURE LEVEL WELL ABOVE THE LIMITS: SOMETHING LIKE +200 TO +300 CELSIUS MORE THAN THE TEMPERATURES MEASURED BY THE MANUFACTURER DURING THE CERTIFICATION TESTS.""  THE COMPRESSOR SECTION OF THE ENGINE WAS UNDAMAGED AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF IMPACT MARKS.  THE ENGINE MANUFACTURER SAID THE CONDITION OF THE COMPRESSOR SECTION INDICATES THAT ""THE ENGINE HAS [HAD] NOT INGESTED ANY FOREIGN OBJECT.""

NO PREIMPACT ENGINE OR AIRFRAME ANOMALIES, WHICH MIGHT HAVE AFFECTED THE HELICOPTER'S PERFORMANCE, WERE IDENTIFIED.

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

AN AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED ON THE PILOT BY THE STATE OF UTAH'S DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, OFFICE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER, SALT LAKE CITY, ON MAY 10, 2000.

TOXICOLOGY TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON THE PILOT BY THE FAA'S CIVIL AEROMEDICAL INSTITUTE (CAMI) IN OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA.  ACCORDING TO CAMI'S REPORT (#200000101001), THE PILOT'S CARBON MONOXIDE, CYANIDE, AND DRUG TESTS WERE NEGATIVE.  CAMI'S REPORT INDICATED THAT THE VOLATILES FOUND IN THE BLOOD AND MUSCLE SAMPLES ""MAY POTENTIALLY BE FROM POSTMORTEM ETHANOL FORMATION, AND NOT FROM THE INGESTION OF ETHANOL.""

ADDITIONAL DATA

THE HELICOPTER, INCLUDIN","THE PILOT WAS ASSIGNED TO FLY FOR A GEOPHYSICAL SEISMIC TEAM IN RUGGED HIGH DESERT CONDITIONS (ELEVATION 5,366 FEET). ON HIS SECOND DAY OF FLYING, HE WAS REQUESTED, BY ONE OF THE TEAM MEMBERS, TO ""FLY A LITTLE EASIER; LESS AGGRESSIVELY.""  ON HIS THIRD DAY OF FLYING, HE WAS ASSIGNED TO PICK UP FIVE TEAM MEMBERS AND THEIR EQUIPMENT.  ONCE AIRBORNE (DENSITY ALTITUDE WAS 8,908 FEET), HE HAD BEEN BRIEFED THAT HE WOULD RECEIVE GPS TEAM DISTRIBUTION COORDINATES; INSTEAD, HE WAS INSTRUCTED TO LAND AND HOLD FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.  A WITNESS OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER FLY EASTBOUND, AND THEN MAKE A 45 TO 60 DEGREE BANK TURN [180 DEGREES] BACK TO THE WEST.  THE WITNESS THEN SAW THE HELICOPTER TURN SOUTHBOUND, LOWER ITS NOSE DOWN ALMOST VERTICALLY, AND THEN REDUCE ITS NOSE LOW PITCH TO APPROXIMATELY 45 DEGREES AS IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.  POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED THAT THE MANUAL THROTTLE POINTER ON THE FUEL CONTROL WAS IN THE EMERGENCY POSITION.  THE FIRST AND SECOND STAGE TURBINE WHEELS WERE FOUND WITH THEIR BLADES 50 TO 70 PERCENT MELTED, INDICATING AN ENGINE THAT FUNCTIONED FOR A TIME AT A TEMPERATURE LEVEL WELL ABOVE ITS LIMITS.","THE PILOT'S LOSS OF AIRCRAFT CONTROL DUE TO ABRUPT FLIGHT MANEUVERING.  CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE THE HIGH DENSITY ALTITUDE WEATHER CONDITION, THE TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DUE TO THE PILOT MANUALLY INTRODUCING EXCESSIVE FUEL INTO THE ENGINE AND OVER TEMPING THE TURBINE SECTION, AND THE LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN FOR THE ENSUING AUTOROTATION."

ON AUGUST 18, 2000, ABOUT 1755 PACIFIC DAYLIGHT TIME, A ROBINSON R22 BETA, N8313Z, EXPERIENCED THE IN-FLIGHT SEPARATION OF ITS MAIN ROTOR BLADE ASSEMBLY WHILE CRUISING OR MANEUVERING.  THE HELICOPTER, IN AN UNCONTROLLED DESCENT, CRASHED INTO A PLOWED FIELD AND BURNED NEAR WATSONVILLE, CALIFORNIA.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED, AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE LOCAL AREA INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT.  THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR, WHO HELD AN AIRLINE TRANSPORT PILOT CERTIFICATE, AND THE STUDENT PILOT WERE FATALLY INJURED.  THE HELICOPTER, WHICH WAS REGISTERED TO AND OPERATED BY THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR, WAS DESTROYED.  THE FLIGHT WAS PERFORMED UNDER 14 CFR PART 91 AND ORIGINATED FROM THE WATSONVILLE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, WATSONVILLE, ABOUT 1715.

SANTA CRUZ COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL REPORTED THAT THEIR INVESTIGATION INDICATED THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR HAD AN APPOINTMENT AT THE WATSONVILLE AIRPORT ABOUT 1600.  AIRPORT PERSONNEL REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD INVESTIGATOR THAT THIS WAS THE STUDENT'S FIRST FLIGHT IN THE ROBINSON HELICOPTER, AND IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A ""FAMILIARIZATION"" FLIGHT.

FIVE GROUND-BASED WITNESSES, WHO REPORTED OBSERVING THE HELICOPTER DURING THE ACCIDENT SEQUENCE, WERE SUBSEQUENTLY INTERVIEWED.  IN SUMMARY, THEY REPORTED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION.  THREE OF THE WITNESSES WERE DRIVING SEPARATE WORK TRUCKS EASTBOUND ALONG THE SAME ROAD, AND TWO WERE STANDING TOGETHER IN A PARKING LOT IN WATSONVILLE.  THE LEAD DRIVER HEARD A LOUD NOISE, LOOKED UP AND SAW A HELICOPTER HEADED NOSE DOWN WITH PIECES OF METAL COMING OFF IT.  HE SAW NO SMOKE OR FLAMES, BUT HE SAW THE HELICOPTER HIT THE GROUND, FOLLOWED BY A RESULTING EXPLOSION AND FLAMES.  THE SECOND AND THIRD DRIVERS SAW THE HELICOPTER FLYING IN A STRAIGHT AND LEVEL ATTITUDE SECONDS BEFORE THE CRASH.  THE SECOND DRIVER REPORTED HEARING A LOUD NOISE AND DESCRIBED A BLADE DETACHING FROM THE HELICOPTER AS IT DESCENDED AND VANISHED BEHIND AN EMBANKMENT.  THE THIRD DRIVER, WHO HAD HIS TRUCK WINDOWS ROLLED UP, REPORTED HEARING ONLY WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS NORMAL HELICOPTER NOISE AND THEN SEEING THE BLADES COME OFF THE HELICOPTER, AFTER WHICH THE HELICOPTER HEADED NOSE DOWN.   NONE OF THESE THREE WITNESSES SAW ANY SMOKE OR FIRE BEFORE IMPACT, AND NONE SAW ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. 

ONE OF THE TWO WITNESSES STANDING IN THE PARKING LOT STATED HE WAS LOOKING TOWARD THE WEST WHEN HE OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER FLYING TOWARD HIM AND HEARD WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS NORMAL HELICOPTER NOISE.  HE NOTICED A ""MOVEMENT"" AND THEN ANOTHER ""LARGER MOVEMENT"" IN THE HELICOPTER.  HE SAID IT LOOKED LIKE THE HELICOPTER WAS FLYING JUST ABOVE SOME TELEPHONE POLES, AND THEN IT APPEARED TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN BACK TO THE WEST AND STARTED TO CLIMB.  DURING THE TURN, HE HEARD THE SOUND OF ""SOMETHING SPEEDING UP.""  AT THAT POINT, THE HELICOPTER SEEMED TO EXPLODE; IN HIS WORDS SOME OTHER ""MATERIAL"" BECAME VISIBLE IN THE AIR.  THEN THE HELICOPTER DESCENDED RAPIDLY TO THE GROUND.  THIS MAN STATED HE SAW WHAT LOOKED TO HIM LIKE SMOKE IN THE AIR AFTER THE EXPLOSION, BUT NO FLAMES WHILE THE HELICOPTER WAS IN THE AIR.  THE SECOND MAN IN THE PARKING LOT HEARD AN UNUSUAL LOUD NOISE, WHICH CAUSED HIM TO LOOK UP AND SEE THE HELICOPTER FALL RAPIDLY TO THE GROUND.  HE SAW FLAMES AFTER IMPACT, BUT DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO OBSERVE WHETHER THERE WERE FLAMES WHILE THE HELICOPTER WAS IN THE AIR.  NEITHER MAN REPORTED SEEING ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.  

FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION

THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR POSSESSED AN AIRLINE TRANSPORT PILOT CERTIFICATE WITH MULTIENGINE LAND PRIVILEGES.  HE HAD COMMERCIAL PILOT PRIVILEGES IN SINGLE ENGINE LAND AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS.  HE HELD FLIGHT ENGINEER, GROUND INSTRUCTOR, AND AIRFRAME AND POWERPLANT MECHANIC CERTIFICATES.  HE WAS A CERTIFIED FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR FOR SINGLE ENGINE AND MULTIENGINE AIRPLANES, AND ROTORCRAFT HELICOPTERS.  ON APRIL 4, 2000, HE WAS ISSUED A SECOND-CLASS AVIATION MEDICAL CERTIFICATE WITH THE RESTRICTION THAT HE MUST WEAR CORRECTIVE LENSES.  

THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD INVESTIGATOR WAS PROVIDED WITH A PHOTOCOPY OF A PORTION OF THE INSTRUCTOR'S FLIGHT LOGBOOK RECORDS FOR REVIEW.  IN PART, THE RECORDS COVERED THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN 1984 AND 1997.  THE EXECUTOR OF THE INSTRUCTOR'S ESTATE REPORTED THAT NO CURRENT FLIGHT LOGBOOK RECORDS WERE LOCATED.  THE MOST RECENT LOGBOOK RECORD, CONTAINED IN LOGBOOK NUMBER 4, WAS OBSERVED TO HAVE AN ENDING DATE OF OCTOBER 25, 1997.  THE RECORDS INDICATED THAT THE INSTRUCTOR RECEIVED DUAL FLIGHT INSTRUCTION IN THE ROBINSON R22 STARTING IN JANUARY 1996.  IN MAY 1996, HE ATTENDED A SAFETY COURSE FOR PILOTS AT THE ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY.  ON HIS COURSE APPLICATION FORM, HE INDICATED THAT HIS TOTAL HELICOPTER FLYING EXPERIENCE WAS 1,000 HOURS, AND HIS FLYING EXPERIENCE IN THE R22 WAS 10 HOURS.

THEREAFTER, HE FLEW THE ROBINSON R22 FOR OVER 400 HOURS.  HIS LOGBOOK ALSO INDICATES THAT DURING THIS PERIOD HE FLEW THE R22 TO AND PERFORMED IN OVER 2 DOZEN AIR SHOWS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.  ON MAY 26, 1999, THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION ISSUED THE INSTRUCTOR A STATEMENT OF ACROBATIC COMPETENCY.  

THE HOURS INDICATED IN THIS REPORT ARE ESTIMATES, AND ARE ALSO BASED IN PART UPON THE INSTRUCTOR'S MEDICAL APPLICATION DATA SUPPLIED TO THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA).  THE INSTRUCTOR'S ESTIMATED TOTAL FLIGHT TIME WAS ABOUT 16,000 HOURS.  HE HAD IN EXCESS OF 400 HOURS FLIGHT TIME PILOTING THE ROBINSON R22.  THE NUMBER OF HOURS OF DUAL FLIGHT INSTRUCTION GIVEN WAS NOT DETERMINED.  HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO THE FAA, THE INSTRUCTOR HAD TRAINED AT LEAST ONE STUDENT IN ROTORCRAFT.      

STUDENT PILOT INFORMATION

THE STUDENT PILOT DID NOT POSSESS ANY FAA PILOT OR MEDICAL CERTIFICATES.  THE STUDENT'S FATHER REPORTED TO THE SAFETY BOARD INVESTIGATOR THAT HE TOOK HIS SON FLYING IN A CESSNA 152 SEVERAL YEARS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.  IN ADDITION, ABOUT 6 MONTHS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, THE STUDENT FLEW IN A HELICOPTER.  THE FATHER STATED THAT THESE WERE THE ONLY TWO FLIGHTS THAT HE WAS AWARE HIS SON HAD TAKEN.

HELICOPTER INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER, SERIAL NUMBER 2456, WAS MANUFACTURED IN JULY 1994 AND WAS ISSUED A STANDARD AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATE.  THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR PURCHASED THE HELICOPTER IN MAY 1999, AND HE MAINTAINED IT BY PERFORMING 100-HOUR INSPECTIONS.

IN FEBRUARY 2000, THE FAA GRANTED APPROVAL TO THE ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY (RHC) TO INCREASE THE AIRFRAME TIME BETWEEN OVERHAULS (TBO) FOR ROBINSON R22 HELICOPTERS TO 2,200 HOURS.  A REVIEW OF THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER'S AIRFRAME AND ENGINE LOGBOOKS REVEALED THAT THE HELICOPTER HAD BEEN MAINTAINED ON A 100-HOUR AND ANNUAL INSPECTION BASIS. 

THE LAST MAINTENANCE ENTRY SHOWN IN THE HELICOPTER'S AIRCRAFT AND ENGINE LOGBOOKS  WAS DATED JULY 10, 2000.  ON THIS DATE, THE HELICOPTER RECEIVED A 100-HOUR INSPECTION THAT WAS SIGNED BY THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR/MECHANIC.  THERE WAS ALSO AN ANNUAL INSPECTION SIGNOFF BY ANOTHER MECHANIC HAVING INSPECTION AUTHORIZATION.  THE LISTED TOTAL AIRCRAFT AND ENGINE TIME WAS 2,099.9 HOURS. 

A SEARCH OF THE SAFETY BOARD'S ACCIDENT DATABASE INDICATED THAT THE HELICOPTER HAD NO PREVIOUS ACCIDENT HISTORY.  AN EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER'S LOGBOOK SIMILARLY DID NOT REVEAL EVIDENCE OF ANY ACCIDENT-RELATED REPAIRS.  

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

THE CLOSEST AVIATION WEATHER OBSERVATION STATION TO THE ACCIDENT SITE IS LOCATED ABOUT 2.4 NAUTICAL MILES NORTH OF THE CRASH SITE AT THE WATSONVILLE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT.  AT 1753, WATSONVILLE'S AUTOMATED SURFACE OBSERVING SYSTEM REPORTED A CLEAR SKY CONDITION.  THE SURFACE WIND WAS FROM 190 DEGREES AT 8 KNOTS, AND THE TEMPERATURE WAS 71 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

COMMUNICATION

A SEARCH OF NEARBY FAA FACILITIES DID NOT REVEAL EVIDENCE THAT ANY AIR-TO-GROUND COMMUNICATIONS OR SERVICES HAD BEEN PROVIDED TO THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER. 

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE ON-SCENE EXAMINATION OF THE ACCIDENT SITE AND WRECKAGE REVEALED THAT THE HELICOPTER AND SEPARATED COMPONENTS CAME TO REST IN AN OPEN FLAT PLOWED FIELD, ON AN ADJACENT ROADWAY, AND IN A LETTUCE FIELD.  THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS ABOUT 2 MILES SOUTH OF THE WATSONVILLE AIRPORT, AT AN ESTIMATED ELEVATION OF 150 (OR LESS) FEET MEAN SEA LEVEL.  

THE MAST, SKID TUBES, ENGINE, TAIL BOOM, AND THE TAIL ROTOR ASSEMBLY WERE FOUND AT THE MAIN IMPACT CRATER/WRECKAGE SITE.  THE MAIN WRECKAGE WAS FOUND PRINCIPALLY ORIENTED TOWARD 160 DEGREES, MAGNETIC. 

THE COCKPIT WAS FOUND IN AN UPRIGHT ATTITUDE AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ESTIMATED 2-FOOT-DEEP IMPACT CRATER.  THE CABIN AREA WAS PITCHED DOWNWARD AT A 45- TO 60-DEGREE ANGLE.  THE CABIN AREA EXHIBITED SOOT PATTERN FIRE EVIDENCE CONSISTENT WITH IT HAVING BEEN PARTIALLY CONSUMED IN A POST IMPACT GROUND FIRE.  FRAGMENTS FROM THE BUBBLE WERE OBSERVED PRINCIPALLY SCATTERED IN THE FIELD SEVERAL YARDS SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.   

AT THE MAIN WRECKAGE IMPACT SITE, THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE LEFT SKID TUBE WAS FOUND IMPACT DAMAGED AND IT WAS PARTIALLY CRUSHED IN AN INWARD DIRECTION AND SCRATCHED IN TWO LOCATIONS ABOUT 3 FEET APART.  THE DEFORMATION TO THE SKID TUBE AND THE SKID TUBE CONTACT SIGNATURE EVIDENCE TERMINATED AT THE UNION BETWEEN THE SKID TUBE AND THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AFT STRUT.    

PLEXIGLAS, LEFT CABIN DOORFRAME MATERIAL AND HEADPHONE FRAGMENTS WERE FOUND ABOUT 400 FEET NORTH OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  THE SIDE (CUP) OF ONE HEADPHONE SET WAS FOUND SHATTERED.  THE CORRESPONDING RIGHT SIDE WAS FOUND INTACT.  FRAGMENTS FROM THE SHATTERED CUP WERE LOCATED ALONG THE WRECKAGE DISTRIBUTION PATH IN THE FIELD LOCATED FARTHEST AWAY FROM WHERE THE MAIN WRECKAGE CAME TO REST.

SUNGLASSES, THE SWASH PLATE BOOT, AND OTHER MATERIAL WERE FOUND BETWEEN 250 AND 330 FEET NORTH OF THE WRECKAGE.  THE LEFT SIDE LANDING GEAR SKID TUBE'S GROUND HANDLING WHEEL BRACKET WAS FOUND SEPARATED FROM THE SKID TUBE, AND IT WAS LOCATED IN THE FIELD APPROXIMATELY 145 FEET NORTH OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  THE BRACKET WAS DEFORMED AND DENTED ON ITS OUTER SURFACE.

THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE TIP WEIGHTS WERE FOUND SEATED IN EACH BLADE, AND THE BLADES WERE IMPACT DAMAGED.  THE SPARS WERE FOUND INTEGRAL TO THE BLADES.  ONE BLADE WAS FOUND BENT IN A DOWNWARD DIRECTION FROM THE SPINDLE OUTBOARD ALONG A 7-FOOT BLADE SPAN.  THE OTHER BLADE WAS SIMILARLY BENT IN A DOWNWARD DIRECTION ALONG A 4-FOOT BLADE SPAN.  A BLACK COLORED TRANSFER OF AN UNIDENTIFIED MATERIAL WAS OBSERVED SMEARED ONTO THE LEADING EDGE OF THIS BLADE, IN AN IMPACTED AREA, ABOUT 9 1/2 FEET OUTBOARD FROM THE HUB.

THE AFT PORTION OF THE LEFT SKID TUBE, IN THE VICINITY OF WHERE THE GROUND-HANDLING WHEEL BRACKET HAD BEEN ATTACHED, WAS PLACED ADJACENT TO THE BENT PORTION OF THIS MAIN ROTOR BLADE.  THE DEFORMED AREA OF THE ROTOR BLADE WAS SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE TO THE IMPACT DAMAGE OBSERVED ON THE SKID TUBE.   

THE MAIN ROTOR HUB AND SPINDLES WERE PARTIALLY DISASSEMBLED AND EXAMINED.  INDENTATIONS AND CHIPPED PRIMER ON BOTH ENDS OF THE HUB WERE OBSERVED IN POSITIONS CORRESPONDING TO THE SPINDLES.  THE SPINDLES WERE EXAMINED AND FOUND TO HAVE SHEARED DROOP STOP TUSKS.  THE SHEARED TUSKS WERE SYMMETRICAL FOR EACH MAIN ROTOR BLADE SPINDLE.  BOTH DROOP STOPS WERE FOUND INTEGRAL TO THEIR MAST ATTACHMENT POINTS AND EXHIBITED COMPRESSION DAMAGE.  THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE GRIPS HAD SCORING ON THEIR INBOARD FACES.    

THE MAIN ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT WAS FOUND BROKEN, AS MEASURED FROM THE TEETER BOLT CENTER, ABOUT 8 INCHES DOWN FROM THE CENTER OF THE TEETER BOLT.  IN THIS AREA, THE SHAFT APPEARED TORSIONALLY TWISTED OFF IN A DIRECTION CONSISTENT WITH ENGINE TORQUE APPLICATION.  THE FRACTURE SURFACE WAS BRIGHT, SHINY, ANGLED, AND TWISTED IN A TORSIONAL DIRECTION.  NO VISUAL EVIDENCE OF FATIGUE WAS FOUND.  NO SIGNS OF CORROSION WERE FOUND IN THE INNER SURFACE AREA OF THE MAST.   

IN THE HUB ASSEMBLY, THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS WERE FOUND DEFORMED:  (1) THE ELASTOMERIC TEETER STOPS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE SHAFT WERE CRUSHED AND SPLIT IN HALF.  (SEE THE ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY (RHC) ILLUSTRATED PARTS CATALOG (IPC) ITEM NUMBER 23 FOR A DRAWING OF THIS PART.); (2) THE ASSOCIATED TEETER STOP BRACKET (IPC #22) WAS FOUND DENTED.  ALSO, ITS ASSOCIATED BRACKET WAS OBSERVED CRUSHED AT A LOCATION ADJACENT TO THE DROOP STOPS; AND  (3) IIMPRESSIONS IN THE MAIN ROTOR HUB BETWEEN 1 AND 2 INCHES INBOARD OF ITS OUTER SURFACES WERE FOUND THAT MATCHED THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF THE MAIN ROTOR SPINDLE TUSK FRACTURE SURFACES.  THE ROBINSON PARTICIPANT INDICATED THAT THE AFOREMENTIONED SIGNATURES ARE INDICATIVE OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES HAVING OVER-TRAVELED IN A DOWNWARD DIRECTION.   

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

THE FAA'S LOS ANGELES CERTIFICATION OFFICE PROJECT MANAGER HAS OVERSIGHT FOR THE ROBINSON R22 AND R44 HELICOPTERS FOR AIRFRAME ISSUES.  THE MANAGER ATTENDED THE STRUCTURAL EXAMINATION OF THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2000.  THE MANAGER VERBALLY INDICATED TO THE SAFETY BOARD'S INVESTIGATOR THAT HE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY EVIDENCE OF A PREIMPACT MECHANICAL PROBLEM WITH THE HELICOPTER, WHICH WOULD HAVE INSTIGATED THE IN-FLIGHT BREAKUP SEQUENCE AND THE ACCIDENT.

THE RHC PUBLISHED SAFETY NOTICE ""SN-11,"" IN WHICH THE COMPANY CAUTIONED ""PUSH-OVERS CAN BE CATASTROPHIC.""  THE NOTICE WAS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN OCTOBER 1982 AND REVISED IN JUNE 1994.  IN PART, THE NOTICE STATED THAT FATAL ACCIDENTS HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY PILOTS PUSHING THE CYCLIC FORWARD, PUTTING THE HELICOPTER INTO A LOW-G (WEI","THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR WAS CRUISING OR MANEUVERING THE HELICOPTER DURING AN INTRODUCTORY FLIGHT WITH A NEW STUDENT.  WITNESSES IN THE AREA REPORTED OBSERVING THE HELICOPTER IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE NORMAL FLIGHT, HEARD A LOUD BANG, AND THEN SAW THE HELICOPTER ABRUPTLY PITCH NOSE DOWN WHILE THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES SEPARATED FROM THE HELICOPTER.  ONE OF THE WITNESSES OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER TURN AND CLIMB MOMENTS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT SEQUENCE INITIATED; TWO OF THE WITNESSES REPORTED THAT JUST PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT THE HELICOPTER WAS FLYING IN LEVEL CRUISE FLIGHT.  AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, THE SKY WAS CLEAR, THE VISIBILITY WAS AT LEAST 10 MILES, A LIGHT BREEZE EXISTED, AND NO OTHER AIRCRAFT WERE FLYING IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA. THE ON-SCENE EXAMINATION OF THE ACCIDENT SITE REVEALED PLEXIGLAS FRAGMENTS AND LEFT DOOR COMPONENTS ABOUT 400 FEET FROM WHERE THE MAIN WRECKAGE FELL INTO AN OPEN DIRT FIELD.  ADDITIONAL ITEMS, INCLUDING SUNGLASSES, A LEFT SKID TUBE-MOUNTED COMPONENT AND THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE ASSEMBLY, WERE FOUND 140 TO 330 FEET FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  AN EXAMINATION OF THE ROTOR HUB REVEALED THE TEETERING STOPS WERE CRACKED AND BOTH OF THE ROTOR BLADE SPINDLES HAD BROKEN THEIR RESPECTIVE (DROOP STOP) TUSKS.  THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THE MAIN ROTOR DIVERGED FROM ITS NORMAL PLANE OF ROTATION, RESULTING IN MAST BUMPING, MAIN ROTOR BLADE CONTACT WITH THE FUSELAGE, AND SEPARATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR ASSEMBLY.  NO EVIDENCE OF ANY PREIMPACT MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION WAS FOUND WITH THE HELICOPTER.  THE INITIATING EVENT THAT PRODUCED THE MAIN ROTOR DIVERGENCE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED.","THE DIVERGENCE OF THE MAIN ROTOR FROM ITS NORMAL PLANE OF ROTATION FOR AN UNDETERMINED REASON, WHICH RESULTED IN MAST BUMPING AND ROTOR CONTACT WITH THE FUSELAGE."

	ON OCTOBER 16, 2000, ABOUT 2355 EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME, A EUROCOPTER AS-355-F2, N355DU, REGISTERED TO DUKE UNIVERSITY, AND OPERATED BY CORPORATE JETS, INC., AS A TITLE 14 CFR PART 91 MAINTENANCE FERRY FLIGHT, CRASHED SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF FROM ALAMANCE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER, BURLINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT THE TIME AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED. THE HELICOPTER WAS DESTROYED AND THE COMMERCIAL-RATED PILOT WAS FATALLY INJURED. THE FLIGHT ORIGINATED ABOUT 1 MINUTE BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.

	THE HELICOPTER WAS DISPATCHED, WITH THE PILOT AND 2 FLIGHT NURSES, FROM DUKE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA, TO ALAMANCE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER, AT ABOUT 2209, TO PICK UP A PATIENT. THE FLIGHT NURSES STATED THAT ABOUT 5 MINUTES BEFORE LANDING AT ALAMANCE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER, THE MAIN TRANSMISSION OIL PRESSURE WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE PILOT OBSERVED THE LIGHT AND REPORTED TO THEM THAT THEY WERE ABOUT EQUAL DISTANCE FROM THE BURLINGTON-ALAMANCE REGIONAL AIRPORT AND THE ALAMANCE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER. THEY ELECTED TO CONTINUE TO THE ALAMANCE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER AND LAND. AFTER LANDING THE PILOT STATED HE WOULD NOT DO AN ENGINE COOL DOWN, AND IMMEDIATELY SHUTDOWN THE ENGINES. DURING THE SHUTDOWN, ONE OF THE FLIGHT NURSES REPORTED NOTICING A BURNING TYPE SMELL. THIS WAS BROUGHT TO THE PILOT'S ATTENTION AND HE STATED IT WAS PROBABLY DUE TO THE QUICK SHUTDOWN. THE FLIGHT BACK TO DUKE HOSPITAL WITH THE PATIENT WAS CANCELED AND A MECHANIC WAS DISPATCHED TO REPAIR THE HELICOPTER. ONE OF THE FLIGHT NURSES STATED THAT PRIOR TO LEAVING IN AN AMBULANCE WITH THE PATIENT, SHE WENT BACK TO THE HELICOPTER AND SPOKE WITH THE PILOT. THE PILOT TOLD HER IT WAS PROBABLY A SHORT IN A LIGHT SWITCH. (SEE FLIGHT NURSE STATEMENTS.) 

	THE MECHANIC STATED HE ARRIVED AT THE HELICOPTER ABOUT 2330. THE PILOT REPORTED TO HIM THAT ALL WAS NORMAL EXCEPT FOR THE TRANSMISSION OIL PRESSURE LIGHT BEING ILLUMINATED. THE MECHANIC STATED HE THEN INSPECTED THE HELICOPTER FOR EXCESSIVE OIL LEAKS AND NONE WERE FOUND. HE THEN DISCONNECTED THE WIRE FROM THE TRANSMISSION OIL PRESSURE SWITCH AND THE LIGHT WENT OUT. THE MECHANIC STATED IN INTERVIEW WITH THE NTSB THAT HE DID NOT RECONNECT THE TRANSMISSION OIL PRESSURE SWITCH WIRE PRIOR TO THE HELICOPTER TAKING OFF. DUE TO PAST YEARS OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS SWITCH AS KNOWN BY HIMSELF AND THE PILOT, THEY MADE A DECISION TO GROUND RUN AND HOVER THE HELICOPTER AND IF THERE WERE NO OTHER INDICATIONS SUCH AS VIBRATION, NOISE, CHIP LIGHT, OR TEMPERATURE INDICATION, AND IF THE PILOT FELT COMFORTABLE WITH THE HELICOPTER, THE PILOT WOULD FLY IT BACK TO DUKE HOSPITAL. THE MECHANIC OBSERVED FROM THE GROUND, AND AFTER A PERIOD OF RUN UP AND THEN HOVERING TIME, THE PILOT TURNED ON HIS LANDING LIGHT AND TOOK OFF. (SEE MECHANIC STATEMENT).

	TRANSCRIPTS OF COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE PILOT OF N355DU AND THE DUKE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, LIFE FLIGHT OPERATION CENTER, SHOWED THAT PILOT REPORTED AT 2224 THAT THE MAIN GEARBOX OIL PRESSURE LIGHT HAD ILLUMINATED AND THAT THEY WOULD LAND AT ALAMANCE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER. AT 2228, THE PILOT REPORTED ARRIVING AT ALAMANCE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER. AT 2347, THE PILOT REPORTED THAT N355DU IS IN SERVICE. AT 2348, THE HELICOPTER IS DISPATCHED FROM ALAMANCE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER. NO FURTHER TRANSMISSIONS WERE RECEIVED FROM THE PILOT. (SEE TRANSCRIPT OF COMMUNICATIONS.)    

	WITNESSES LOCATED NEAR THE CRASH SITE, ABOUT 1.3 STATUTE MILES EAST-SOUTHEAST FROM THE TAKEOFF POINT, REPORTED HEARING THE HELICOPTER APPROACHING AT WHAT APPEARED TO BE A LOW ALTITUDE. THEY STATED THE HELICOPTER DID NOT SOUND NORMAL TO THEM AND WAS MAKING A STEADY DRONE AND A LOW VELOCITY THUMPING NOISE. THEY THEN HEARD THE SOUND OF TREE LIMBS BREAKING AND THE HELICOPTER CRASH TO THE GROUND. A POSTCRASH FIRE ERUPTED. (SEE WITNESS STATEMENTS).

NEXT, REPLACE THE OIL PRESSURE MICROSWITCH. FINALLY, IF THERE IS NO ELECTRICAL ANOMALY, REMOVE THE MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX AND ROTOR MAST ASSEMBLY FOR MAJOR OVERHAUL. THE MECHANIC WHO WORKED ON N355DU AT THE ALAMANCE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT STATED TO NTSB AFTER THE ACCIDENT THAT HE DID NOT HAVE THE FAULT ISOLATION OR MAINTENANCE MANUALS WITH HIM. HE STATED HE DISCONNECTED THE WIRES FROM THE OIL PRESSURE MICROSWITCH TO THE WARNING LIGHT, AND THE WARNING LIGHT WENT OUT. HE STATED HE BELIEVED THE OIL PRESSURE MICROSWITCH HAD FAILED AND HE WOULD REPLACE THE MICROSWITCH AFTER THE PILOT FERRIED THE HELICOPTER BACK TO THE DUKE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER. (SEE FAULT ISOLATION MANUAL PAGES AND MECHANICS STATEMENT.)

	THE FLIGHT MANUAL FOR THE EUROCOPTER AS-355 STATES IN SECTION 2.1, TITLED RED LIGHTS, THAT ILLUMINATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX (MGB) OIL PRESSURE LIGHT INDICATES MINIMUM MGB OIL PRESSURE WARNING. THE PILOT ACTION IS TO REDUCE ENGINE POWER AND TEST THE INDICATOR LIGHTS TO VERIFY THAT THE MGB TEMPERATURE LIGHT ALSO ILLUMINATES. THE NEXT STEP IS TO LAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE PROCEDURE HAS A NOTE, WHICH STATES ""THE MGB HAS SUCCESSFULLY PASSED A BENCH TEST CONSISTING IN RUNNING THE GEARBOX FOR 45 MINUTES WITH ZERO OIL PRESSURE, AT THE POWER CORRESPONDING TO MINIMUM POWER IN LEVEL FLIGHT (AT 55 KT)."" EUROCOPTER PERSONNEL STATED THAT THE MINIMUM POWER IN LEVEL FLIGHT AT 55 KNOTS IS ABOUT 190 KILOWATTS. THEY STATED THE POWER REQUIRED FOR HOVERING IS ABOUT 450 TO 500 KILOWATTS. (SEE EUROCOPTER REPORT.) 

	THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WAS NOT EQUIPPED WITH A MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX OIL PRESSURE GAUGE. EUROCOPTER PERSONNEL REPORTED TO NTSB THAT EUROCOPTER SERVICE BULLETIN AS-355 NO. 01.04, DATED DECEMBER 11, 1990, GIVES INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING A MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX OIL PRESSURE GAUGE IN THE HELICOPTER. (SEE SERVICE BULLETIN AS-355 NO. 01.04.) 

METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION

	METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION OF 5 GEARS FROM THE MAIN ROTOR COMBINING GEARBOX, THE GEARS AND DRIVE SHAFT FROM MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX OIL PUMP, THE GEARBOX INPUT PINION, 2 PIECES OF THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT, A PORTION OF THE TAIL ROTOR CONTROL ROD, THE LOWER MAST BEARING, LOWER VERTICAL SHAFT BEARING, THE UPPER DRIVE ADAPTER, AND THE NO. 2 ENGINE FOURTH-STAGE TURBINE NOZZLE WAS PERFORMED BY THE NTSB MATERIAL LABORATORY, WASHINGTON, D.C. 

	ALL FIVE MAIN ROTOR COMBINING GEARBOX GEARS HAD A CHARRED APPEARANCE WITH WHITE DEPOSITS ON THE SURFACES. LARGE DEPOSITS OF PREVIOUSLY MOLTEN METALLIC MATERIAL WERE OBSERVED ON THE NO. 2 ENGINE INPUT GEAR. THE GEAR TEETH ON EACH GEAR WERE FLATTENED NEARLY TO THE BASE OF THE TEETH. THE TOOTH DEFORMATION ON THE FIVE GEARS WAS UNIFORM AROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE. OVERALL TOOTH DEFORMATION IN THE RIGHT INTERMEDIATE GEAR WAS GREATER THAN THAT IN THE LEFT INTERMEDIATE GEAR. THE TOOTH DEFORMATION FOR THE NO. 1 ENGINE INPUT GEAR, LEFT INTERMEDIATE GEAR, NO. 2 ENGINE INPUT GEAR, AND RIGHT INTERMEDIATE GEAR WAS SMEARED TOWARD THE COUNTER-CLOCKWISE DIRECTION (AS VIEWED FROM THE AFT), CONSISTENT WITH A CLOCKWISE ROTATION OF THE ENGINE INPUT GEARS RELATIVE TO THE INTERMEDIATE GEARS. THE TEETH IN INPUT GEAR TO THE MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX BEVEL GEAR APPEARED TO BE EVENLY FLATTENED AND DID NOT HAVE A SMEARED APPEARANCE.

	THE MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX OIL PUMP DRIVE SHAFT, WAS FRACTURED ABOUT MID SPAN. MULTIPLE SHALLOW SPIRALING CRACKS WERE OBSERVED ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE SHAFT. THE FRACTURE SURFACE WAS FLAT WITH A ROUGH AREA AT THE CENTER. DEFORMATION AT THE SURFACE ADJACENT TO THE FRACTURE SURFACE WAS CONSISTENT WITH A CLOCKWISE ROTATION OF THE UPPER SURFACE RELATIVE TO THE LOWER SURFACE. THE ORIENTATION OF THE SPIRAL CRACKS AND FRACTURE S","ABOUT 5 MINUTES BEFORE LANDING AT A HOSPITAL, THE MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX (MGB) OIL PRESSURE WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE PILOT CONTINUED TO THE HOSPITAL, LANDED, AND PERFORMED AN IMMEDIATE ENGINE SHUTDOWN. A MECHANIC DISCONNECTED THE WIRING TO THE MGB OIL PRESSURE SWITCH AND THE LIGHT WENT OUT. THE MECHANIC STATED HE BELIEVED THE OIL PRESSURE SWITCH HAD FAILED AND HE ASKED THE PILOT TO RUN THE HELICOPTER, HOVER THE HELICOPTER, AND IF EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL, TO FLY IT BACK TO THE BASE HOSPITAL. THE PILOT DID THE RUN AND HOVER, AND THEN DEPARTED THE HOSPITAL. THE HELICOPTER CRASHED ABOUT 1 MINUTE LATER. WITNESSES STATED THEY HEARD THE HELICOPTER APPROACH THE CRASH SITE AT A LOW ALTITUDE AND MAKING A SLOW THUMPING NOISE. EXAMINATION OF THE MGB SHOWED THE OIL PUMP IDLER GEAR HAD SEIZED IN THE OIL PUMP DUE TO UNDETERMINED REASONS AND THE OIL PUMP DRIVE SHAFT HAD FAILED DUE TO OVERSTRESS. THE TEETH ON THE ENGINE INPUT GEARS, INTERMEDIATE GEARS, AND MGB DRIVE GEAR IN THE MGB COMBINING GEARBOX HAD FAILED DUE TO HIGH-TEMPERATURE OVERSTRESS, WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF OIL STARVATION. THE HELICOPTER WAS NOT EQUIPPED WITH A MGB OIL PRESSURE INDICATOR. THE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURE FOR TROUBLE SHOOTING AN ILLUMINATED MGB OIL PRESSURE WARNING LIGHT IS TO FIRST CHECK THE ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT, AND IF THIS DOES NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM, TO CHANGE THE OIL PRESSURE SWITCH. THE MECHANIC STATED HE DID NOT HAVE THE MAINTENANCE MANUALS WITH HIM WHILE WORKING ON THE HELICOPTER. THE MGB HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN THE HELICOPTER AFTER OVERHAUL, 3 DAYS AND 4 FLIGHT HOURS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.","THE MECHANICS FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH MANUFACTURERS INSTRUCTIONS FOR CORRECTION OF A ILLUMINATED MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX OIL PRESSURE WARNING LIGHT RESULTING IN THE HELICOPTER BEING DISPATCHED ON A FERRY FLIGHT WITH A FAILED MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX OIL PUMP, FAILURE OF THE MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX COMBINING GEARBOX GEARS DUE TO OIL STARVATION, LOSS OF MAIN ROTOR RPM, AND THE HELICOPTER COLLIDING WITH TREES AND THE GROUND DURING AN UNCONTROLLED DESCENT."

LIKE THE NUMBER 1 ENGINE, IT WAS LAST INSPECTED ON FEBRUARY 10, 2001.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED ON A SOUTHERLY HEADING AND CAME TO REST IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION.  FIRE CONSUMED THE FUSELAGE.  THE TAIL BOOM WAS FRAGMENTED FROM ITS FORWARD ATTACH POINT TO APPROXIMATELY 18 INCHES FORWARD OF THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZERS.  THE ENGINES WERE DETACHED FROM THE AIRFRAME DUE TO IMPACT AND FIRE, BUT REMAINED IN THE AREA WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE NORMALLY BEEN MOUNTED.  

BASED ON WITNESS INFORMATION CONCERNING PIECES COMING OFF THE HELICOPTER IN FLIGHT, AN EXTENSIVE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED BACK ALONG THE PROJECTED FLIGHT PATH OF  THE HELICOPTER.  SEVERAL PIECES OF TRANSMISSION COWLING WERE FOUND ALONG THIS PATH.  THE PIECES ALL CAME FROM AROUND THE TOP OF THE TRANSMISSION COWLING.  THEY WERE FRAGMENTED, BUT DID NOT EXHIBIT HEAT OR FIRE DAMAGE.  IN ADDITION, PIECES OF MAIN ROTOR BLADE COVER MATERIAL AND BLADE CORE HONEYCOMB MATERIAL WERE FOUND IN THE SAME AREA.  WITNESS MARKS PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT THE MAIN ROTOR CONTROL ROD ENDS WERE AT THE LEVEL WHERE IMPACT DAMAGE WAS INCURRED ON THE COWL PIECES.

THE MAIN GEAR BOX (TRANSMISSION) REMAINED INTACT BUT WAS DAMAGED BY BOTH IMPACT AND FIRE.  ROTATION OF THE INPUT QUILL PRODUCED NORMAL ROTATION OF THE MAST, AND THE MAIN DRIVE SHAFT OUTER COUPLING REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE DRIVE GEAR OF THE COMBINING GEARBOX.  THE DRIVE SHAFT FORWARD INNER COUPLING WAS INTACT AS WAS THE COMPLETE AFT COUPLING ASSEMBLY.  RADIAL SCORING WAS PRESENT ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE SHAFT.

THE MAIN ROTOR CONTROLS WERE STILL PRESENT ON THE MAST BUT WERE DAMAGED BY BOTH IMPACT AND FIRE. THE CONTROLS WERE EXAMINED AND NO EVIDENCE OF PREIMPACT FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION WAS FOUND.

THE MAIN ROTOR HUB AND BLADE ASSEMBLY WAS DAMAGED BY IMPACT AND FIRE.  THE YOKES WERE FRACTURED IN THE INBOARD FLEXURE AREA.  THE FRACTURES WERE CONSISTENT WITH OVERLOAD.  THE CORE PORTION OF EACH FRACTURED YOKE REMAINED ATTACHED TO ITS RESPECTIVE SPINDLE AND DAMPER BRIDGE, AND ALL WERE DAMAGED BY BOTH FIRE AND IMPACT.  NO EVIDENCE OF PREIMPACT FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION WAS FOUND.

ALL FOUR MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR.  THREE OF THE BLADES WERE DAMAGED BY FIRE.  ALL THE BLADES WERE FRACTURED BETWEEN 51 AND 84 INCHES FROM THE INBOARD ATTACH POINTS IN THE AREA WHERE THE SPAR NARROWS. TRIANGULAR SHAPED SKIN SECTIONS WERE BROKEN OUT OF TWO OF THE BLADES ADJACENT TO THE FRACTURE AREAS.  THE FRACTURE AREAS EXHIBITED UPWARD BENDING INDICATIVE OF OVERLOAD FAILURE AND THE LEADING EDGE OF ALL BLADES CONTAINED DAMAGE CONSISTENT WITH OBJECT IMPACT DURING ROTATION. 

THE HYDRAULIC SERVO ACTUATORS WERE ALL DAMAGED BY IMPACT AND FIRE AND EXHIBITED NUMEROUS FRACTURE AREAS CONSISTENT WITH IMPACT OVERLOAD.  NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND OF PRE IMPACT FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION.

THE TAIL BOOM WAS FRAGMENTED FORWARD OF THE ELEVATORS AND A CREASE WAS NOTED ON THE LEFT SIDE.  THE CREASE ANGLED DOWNWARD TO AFT OF THE ELEVATORS.  THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF THE CREASE WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE LEADING EDGE SHAPE OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES.  THE LEFT STABILIZER SEPARATED FROM THE TAIL BOOM AND WAS CRUSHED AFT FROM THE LEADING EDGE TOWARD THE SPAR.  THE VERTICAL STABILIZER WAS FRACTURED CONSISTENT WITH IMPACT OVERLOAD.

THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT WAS FRACTURED IN NUMEROUS PLACES AND THE FORWARD PORTION WAS DAMAGED BY FIRE. THE HANGAR BEARINGS AND COUPLINGS WERE ALL ACCOUNTED FOR AND EXHIBITED NO FUNCTIONAL DEFECTS.  BOTH THE 42 DEGREE AND 90 DEGREE GEAR BOXES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AND EXHIBITED IMPACT DAMAGE.  ONE TAIL ROTOR BLADE EXHIBITED FIRE DAMAGE AND THE OTHER EXHIBITED IMPACT DAMAGE WITH BENDING OF ABOUT 45 DEGREES TOWARD THE TAIL BOOM.  THE CONTROL LINKAGE WAS INTACT, BUT DEFORMED FROM IMPACT FORCES.

THE ENGINES EXHIBITED BOTH FIRE AND IMPACT DAMAGE, AND THE COMBINING AND ACCESSORY GEAR BOXES WERE CONSUMED BY FIRE.  THERE WERE NO NO INDICATIONS FOUND OF ANY PRE-IMPACT FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OF ANY OF THE ENGINE COMPONENTS EXAMINED.  BOTH THE LEFT AND RIGHT ENGINE POWER TURBINES DISPLAYED LIGHT ROTATIONAL SIGNATURES AND STATIC IMPRINT MARKS CHARACTERISTIC OF LOW ROTATIONAL ENERGY AT THE TIME OF IMPACT.   BOTH THE LEFT AND RIGHT GAS GENERATOR SECTION INTERNAL COMPONENTS DISPLAYED STRONG ROTATIONAL SIGNATURES CHARACTERISTIC OF THE GAS GENERATOR SECTIONS DEVELOPING SIGNIFICANT POWER AT THE TIME OF IMPACT.  ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER, THIS CONDITION COULD RESULT FROM HIGH POWER SELECTION AND HIGH POWER TURBINE BACK PRESSURE DUE TO LOW ROTOR SPEED.     

TESTS AND RESEARCH

ACCORDING TO INFORMATION PROVIDED BY BELL HELICOPTER TEXTRON, AS THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM SLOWS WHILE UNDER AERODYNAMIC LOAD, THE MAIN GEAR BOX CAN ""WALK"" (HORIZONTAL ORBITAL MOVEMENT) ON ITS MOUNTING STRUCTURE.  WHEN THIS OCCURS, THE CONTROL ROD ENDS CAN COME IN CONTACT WITH THE TRANSMISSION COWL.

ON JANUARY 18, 2002, AT 0024 EASTERN STANDARD TIME, AN MBB (EUROCOPTER) BK 117 A-3 HELICOPTER, N626MB, OPERATED BY CJ SYSTEMS AVIATION GROUP, WAS DESTROYED WHEN IT COLLIDED WITH A BRICK FACADE DURING A TAKE-OFF FROM A ROOF-TOP HELIPAD AT THE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS OF CLEVELAND, CLEVELAND, OHIO.  THE CERTIFICATED COMMERCIAL PILOT AND THE FLIGHT NURSE WERE FATALLY INJURED, AND THE PARAMEDIC WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED.  NIGHT VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED, AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE MEDEVAC FLIGHT CONDUCTED UNDER 14 CFR PART 91.

AT 0017, THE MEDEVAC CREW WAS NOTIFIED OF AN EMERGENCY PATIENT PICK-UP AT THE LAKE WEST HOSPITAL, EASTLAKE, OHIO.  

ACCORDING TO THE PARAMEDIC, HE AND THE FLIGHT NURSE GATHERED THEIR MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND WALKED OUT TO THE HELICOPTER, WHICH WAS ON THE PRIMARY (EASTERN MOST) HELIPAD, FACING SOUTHWEST.  THEY STOWED THEIR EQUIPMENT ONBOARD WHILE THE PILOT CONDUCTED A PRE-FLIGHT INSPECTION OF THE HELICOPTER.

AFTER HE STOWED HIS MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, THE PARAMEDIC CONDUCTED HIS OWN PRE-FLIGHT INSPECTION OF THE HELICOPTER, THEN SAT IN THE LEFT FRONT PILOT SEAT FOR DEPARTURE.

WITH THE CREW ONBOARD AND THE ENGINES STARTED, THE PILOT POSITIONED THE POWER LEVERS FOR FLIGHT.  AS THE HELICOPTER ASCENDED VERTICALLY, THE PILOT TURNED THE NOSE OF THE HELICOPTER TO THE RIGHT (NORTHWEST), SO IT FACED A WALL THAT EXTENDED 10-FEET ABOVE THE HEIGHT OF THE HELIPADS.  THE PARAMEDIC CONTACTED DISPATCH AND THE PILOT CONTACTED BURKE LAKEFRONT AIRPORT CONTROL TOWER.

WHEN THE HELICOPTER WAS APPROXIMATELY 20-FEET ABOVE THE HELIPAD, WHILE THE PARAMEDIC WAS PROGRAMMING THE PANEL MOUNTED GPS, HE FELT A ""SUDDEN GUST"" OF WIND PUSH THE HELICOPTER FROM DIRECTLY BEHIND.  HE WAS NOT ALERTED BY THE WIND GUST, SINCE IT WAS NORMAL TO ENCOUNTER THEM WHEN DEPARTING FROM THIS HELIPORT.  THE PARAMEDIC SAID HE WAS NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING UNUSUAL WITH THE FLIGHT UNTIL HE LOOKED UP, AND NOTICED THE HELICOPTER'S CLOSE PROXIMITY TO A 16-FLOOR BRICK BUILDING, WHICH WAS LOCATED AT THE NORTHERN CORNER OF THE HELIPORT AND EXTENDED ABOVE THE HEIGHT OF THE HELIPAD BY 4 FLOORS.  HE SAID THE NOSE OF THE HELICOPTER WAS ALSO POSITIONED FURTHER TO THE RIGHT THAN BEFORE.

THE PARAMEDIC YELLED, ""BUILDING, BUILDING, BUILDING!"" TO ALERT THE PILOT.  THE PILOT THEN MADE A RAPID RIGHT CYCLIC INPUT, WHICH CAUSED THE HELICOPTER TO MAKE A ""HARD NOSE OVER TO THE RIGHT.""  THE PARAMEDIC SAID THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE HELICOPTER TO COMPLETE THE APPROXIMATELY 180-DEGREE TURN AND CLEAR THE 16-FLOOR BUILDING.  THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES STRUCK THE 16-FLOOR BUILDING FIRST, FOLLOWED BY THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HELICOPTER.  THEN, THE HELICOPTER FELL ABOUT 13 FLOORS TO A CIRCULAR DRIVEWAY AT GROUND LEVEL. 

ADDITIONALLY, THE PARAMEDIC DID NOT SEE OR HEAR ANY WARNING LIGHTS, WARNING HORNS, OR UNUSUAL NOISES, AND WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY MECHANICAL PROBLEMS WITH THE HELICOPTER.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE PILOT DID NOT REPORT ANY PROBLEMS DURING THE FLIGHT.  

A TROOPER WITH THE OHIO STATE HIGHWAY PATROL (OSHP) INTERVIEWED THE PARAMEDIC ON JANUARY 22, 2002.  DURING THE INTERVIEW, THE PARAMEDIC STATED:

""EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL AND [THE PILOT] PULLED PITCH AND WE STARTED TO LIFT OFF.  WE WERE MAYBE ABOUT 20 FEET OFF THE PAD WHEN I FELT A SLIGHT NUDGE.  ALMOST INSTANTLY THE TAIL STARTED PULLING LEFT, THE NOSE PULLED RIGHT AND WENT DOWN IN AN ARC MOTION.  I STARTED YELLING, 'BUILDING, BUILDING', AND WE WENT INTO THE BUILDING.  I COULD SEE THAT [THE PILOT] WAS FIGHTING TO CONTROL IT.""

WHEN ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY WEATHER CONCERNS ON THE NIGHT OF THE ACCIDENT, THE PARAMEDIC STATED THAT IT WAS, ""... CLEAR AS A BELL.  THERE WAS SOME WIND GUSTS BUT IT WAS COLD AS HECK.""

AN OFFICER WITH THE CLEVELAND POLICE AVIATION UNIT STATED THAT HE FLEW TWO MISSIONS ON THE EVENING OF JANUARY 17, 2002.  HE REPORTED THAT WHEN THE FLIGHT ENDED AROUND MIDNIGHT, THE CEILINGS, VISIBILITY, AND FLIGHT CONDITIONS WERE GOOD.  THE WINDS AT THE SURFACE WERE AT LEAST 15 KNOTS FROM THE SOUTHWEST THROUGHOUT THE EVENING, BUT WERE GUSTING TO APPROXIMATELY 25 KNOTS DURING THE FIRST FLIGHT.  THE SURFACE WINDS CALMED DOWN DURING THE SECOND FLIGHT; HOWEVER, THE WINDS AT 500 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL (AGL) REMAINED BRISK THROUGHOUT THE EVENING. THE WIND SPEED WAS AT LEAST 25 KNOTS AND GUSTY.

THE OFFICER ALSO STATED THAT HE ENCOUNTERED LIGHT ""MECHANICAL TURBULENCE"" DURING THE FLIGHTS, WHICH WAS DUE TO THE SOUTH/SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS AND THE HIGH GROUND THAT SURROUNDED THE CLEVELAND METRO AREA.

ADDITIONALLY, THE OFFICER STOOD ON THE HELIPORT ABOUT 0300 ON THE MORNING OF THE ACCIDENT AND NOTED THAT IT WAS STILL VERY WINDY FROM THE WEST/SOUTHWEST AND THE ""MECHANICAL TURBULENCE FROM THE BUILDING WAS EVIDENT.""

A FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) INSPECTOR ALSO EXAMINED THE HELIPORT ABOUT 0300 ON THE MORNING OF THE ACCIDENT.  ACCORDING TO THE INSPECTOR, THE WINDS WERE OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST, AND WERE GUSTING BETWEEN 20 AND 30 KNOTS.  HE SAID THAT AS HE WALKED AROUND THE EDGE OF THE HELIPORT, HE CAUGHT HIMSELF SEVERAL TIMES BACKING AWAY FROM THE EDGE DUE TO THE WIND GUSTS. THE INSPECTOR ALSO STATED THAT THE WIND SEEMED TO SWIRL AROUND THE HELIPORT. 

ACCORDING TO THE OPERATOR'S DISPATCH RECORDS, THE HELICOPTER LIFTED OFF THE HELIPAD AT 0024.

REVIEW OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL COMMUNICATIONS REVEALED THAT THE HELICOPTER CONTACTED THE BURKE LAKEFRONT CONTROL TOWER AT 0024.  THE TOWER RESPONDED SEVEN SECONDS AFTER THE INITIAL CALL AND ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT THE PILOT, BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE.  THERE WERE NO DISTRESS OR EMERGENCY CALLS MADE FROM THE CREW OF THE HELICOPTER.

THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED DURING THE HOURS OF DARKNESS, APPROXIMATELY 41 DEGREES, 03 MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE, AND 081 DEGREES, 36 MINUTES WEST LONGITUDE.

EXAMINATION OF THE PILOT'S FLIGHT DUTY TIME RECORDS SINCE OCTOBER 2001 REVEALED THAT HE HAD FLOWN THE BK-117 A TOTAL OF 41.7 HOURS; 24.4 HOURS AT NIGHT, AND MADE 114 NIGHT LANDINGS.

REVIEW OF THE PILOT'S DUTY TIME RECORDS REVEALED THAT HE WAS OFF DUTY FROM JANUARY 10-15, 2002.  ON JANUARY 16, 2002, HE WORKED A 12-HOUR DAY SHIFT FROM 0700-1900.  ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, HE WAS SCHEDULED TO WORK A 12-HOUR NIGHT SHIFT THAT BEGAN AT 1900 ON JANUARY 17, 2002 AND ENDED AT 0700 ON JANUARY 18, 2002.

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

WEATHER AT BURKE LAKEFRONT AIRPORT, ABOUT 3 NAUTICAL MILES NORTHWEST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, AT 0046, WAS REPORTED AS WIND FROM 230 DEGREES AT 10 KNOTS, VISIBILITY 10 STATUTE MILES, CEILING OVERCAST AT 5,000 FEET, TEMPERATURE 26 DEGREES F, DEWPOINT 16 DEGREES F, AND ALTIMETER SETTING 30.08 INCHES HG.

HELIPORT INFORMATION

THE HOSPITAL'S HELIPORT WAS LOCATED ON THE ROOF OF A 12-FLOOR BUILDING AND INCLUDED TWO INTERCONNECTED HELIPADS THAT WERE 60 FEET LONG 50 FEET WIDE, AND 30 FEET APART. ON THE NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE HELIPORT, THERE WERE TWO ATTACHED BUILDINGS THAT EXTENDED ABOVE THE HEIGHT OF THE HELIPADS BY APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET.   A 16-FLOOR BRICK BUILDING WAS ALSO LOCATED NEAR THE NORTH CORNER OF THE HELIPORT AND WAS ATTACHED TO ONE OF THE SHORTER BUILDINGS, WHICH HOUSED THE HELIPORT'S STABILIZATION AREA. 

THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY 90 FEET OF CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE CENTER OF THE PRIMARY HELIPAD AND THE CLOSEST POINT OF THE 16-FLOOR BUILDING.

THE HELIPORT WAS EQUIPPED WITH LIGHTING FOR NIGHT OPERATIONS.  A LIGHTED 20-KNOT WINDSOCK WAS LOCATED ON THE ROOF OF ONE OF THE 10-FOOT HIGH BUILDINGS AND ON TOP OF THE 16-FLOOR BUILDING.  

ACCORDING TO THE OPERATOR'S DIRECTOR OF SAFETY, THERE WERE FOUR PRIMARY AND TWO ALTERNATE APPROACH AND DEPARTURE PATHS TO AND FROM THE HELIPORT.  THESE POINTS WERE CONTAINED WITHIN A 190-200 DEGREE ARC.  IT WAS THE PILOT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE THE PROPER APPROACH AND DEPARTURE ALIGNMENT BASED ON THE EXISTING WIND CONDITIONS AND HELIPORT TRAFFIC.

THE DIRECTOR OF SAFETY ALSO DESCRIBED A NORMAL DEPARTURE PROCEDURE FROM THE PRIMARY HELIPAD.  HE SAID THAT THE PILOT WOULD LIFT THE HELICOPTER INTO A LOW HOVER  [3-5 FOOT SKID HEIGHT ABOVE THE PAD], PERFORM A QUICK SCAN OF THE INSTRUMENT PANEL, AND THEN A CREWMEMBER WOULD CONTACT THE COMPANY DISPATCHER.  WHEN THE DISPATCHER ACKNOWLEDGED THE CALL, THE HELICOPTER WOULD ASCEND TO AN APPROXIMATE 20-FOOT SKID HEIGHT FOR A RADIO CALL TO BURKE LAKEFRONT CONTROL TOWER PRIOR TO DEPARTING.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THIS OUT OF GROUND EFFECT HOVER ALLOWED LINE-OF-SIGHT RECEPTION FOR THE BELLY MOUNTED RADIO ANTENNA AND SKID CLEARANCE OVER THE 10-FOOT HIGH BUILDINGS.  THE DIRECTOR OF SAFETY ALSO SAID THAT IT WAS NORMAL PROCEDURE TO DEPART THE HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT ONLY AFTER TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION WAS ESTABLISHED WITH BURKE LAKEFRONT CONTROL TOWER.

THE FAA INSPECTOR WHO EXAMINED THE HELIPORT ENVIRONMENT A FEW HOURS AFTER THE ACCIDENT STATED THAT ONE OF THE PERIMETER LIGHTS ON THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE PRIMARY HELIPAD WAS OUT OF SERVICE, BUT SUFFICIENT LIGHTING EXISTED FOR TAKE-OFF AND LANDING.  

WRECKAGE INFORMATION

THE WRECKAGE WAS EXAMINED ON JANUARY 19-20, 2002. THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST AT THE BASE OF THE HOSPITAL, BELOW THE PRIMARY HELIPAD.  ALL MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE HELICOPTER WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE ACCIDENT SITE.

IMPACT MARKS WERE OBSERVED ON THE SOUTHWEST FACADE OF THE 16-FLOOR BUILDING ABOUT 25-FEET ABOVE THE HEIGHT OF THE HELIPAD. A CORNER SECTION OF THIS BUILDING WAS KNOCKED OUT, AND THERE WERE FOUR 5- TO 7-INCH-WIDE FAN-SHAPED IMPACT MARKS LOCATED BELOW AND TO THE LEFT OF THE DAMAGED CORNER. THE FAN-SHAPED MARKS WERE GRAY AND YELLOW IN COLOR. DESCENDING BELOW AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE FAN-SHAPED MARKS WERE BLUE AND WHITE COLORED PAINT TRANSFERS.

IMPACT MARKS WERE ALSO FOUND ON THE HOSPITAL'S STABILIZATION AREA ROOF, LOCATED BETWEEN THE HELIPORT AND THE 16-FLOOR BUILDING, AND ON A 10TH-FLOOR OUTCROPPING ABOVE THE WRECKAGE SITE.

THE HELIPORT, AS WELL AS LEDGES, OUTCROPPINGS, AND ROOFTOPS WERE LITTERED WITH HELICOPTER DEBRIS.  AMONG THE DEBRIS WERE THE YAW CSAS ACTUATOR, TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT, A TAIL ROTOR BLADE TIP, MAIN ROTOR TIP CAP, SECTIONS OF AN END PLATE, BLUE PAINT CHIPS, PIECES OF BRICK, GRAY PIECES OF MAIN ROTOR BLADE, A MAIN ROTOR BLADE INTERNAL WEIGHT, FOAM, AND COMPOSITE MATERIAL.

THE MAIN WRECKAGE CAME TO REST ON ITS LEFT SIDE, AND FACED APPROXIMATELY 122 DEGREES MAGNETIC.  THE COCKPIT AND FUSELAGE WERE CONSUMED BY POST-IMPACT FIRE.  THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM, TRANSMISSION, ENGINES, AND TANDEM HYDRAULIC UNIT HAD ALSO SUSTAINED EXTENSIVE FIRE DAMAGE.

FLIGHT CONTROL CONTINUITY COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED DUE TO THE EXTENT OF FIRE DAMAGE.  HOWEVER, ALL OF THE FLIGHT CONTROLS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE BELL CRANKS, CONTROL RODS, LEVERS, AND ASSOCIATED HARDWARE WERE ACCOUNTED FOR FROM THE COCKPIT TO EACH RESPECTIVE CONTROL SURFACE.  

THREE OF THE FOUR MAIN ROTOR BLADES REMAINED PARTIALLY ATTACHED TO THE MAIN ROTOR HEAD, BUT HAD SEPARATED FROM EXTENSIVE FIRE DAMAGE OUTBOARD OF THE PENDULUM VIBRATION DAMPER.  EACH OF THE THREE BLADES CAME TO REST NEAR THE MAIN WRECKAGE, AND WERE DESTROYED BY FIRE.  THE FOURTH BLADE WAS LOCATED AT THE BASE OF THE 16-FLOOR BUILDING AND WAS SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN ROTOR AT THE ROOT FITTING. THE OUTBOARD SECTION OF THE BLADE EXHIBITED BROOM STRAW FRACTURES, AND THERE WERE WHITE AND GREEN COLORED TRANSFERS MARKS ALONG THE TOP SURFACE OF THE BLADE.

EXAMINATION OF THE TANDEM HYDRAULIC UNIT REVEALED THAT IT WAS SET TO THE PRIMARY SYSTEM. 

THE #1 ENGINE WAS BENEATH THE #2 ENGINE.  THE #1 ENGINE'S TURBINE/COMPRESSOR SECTION WAS SEPARATED FROM THE GEARBOX MODULE.  THE COMPRESSOR INTAKE BLADES EXHIBITED DAMAGE, AND SOME METAL DEBRIS WAS FOUND ALONG THE RIM OF THE INTAKE.  THE MAIN DRIVE SHAFT WAS SEPARATED FROM BOTH DIAPHRAGMS BUT DID NOT DISPLAY IMPACT DAMAGE.

THE #2 ENGINE WAS INTACT, BUT EXHIBITED DAMAGE TO THE TAILPIPE AND ACCESSORIES.  THE MAIN DRIVE SHAFT WAS FRACTURED BETWEEN THE TRANSMISSION AND ENGINE.  THE FRACTURED ENDS WERE TWISTED. 

THE TAIL BOOM WAS SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN FUSELAGE AT THE FORWARD ATTACHMENT POINT. THE VERTICAL FIN, TAIL ROTOR, LEFT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER AND ITS END PLATE HAD SEPARATED FROM THE TAIL BOOM.  HOWEVER, THE RIGHT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER AND ITS END PLATE REMAINED ATTACHED.  A SMALL HORIZONTAL IMPACT MARK WAS NOTED AT THE BASE OF THE VERTICAL FIN AND A MAIN ROTOR TIP CAP WAS FOUND ENTANGLED IN VERTICAL FIN STRUCTURE LOCATED NEAR THE FIN'S LEADING EDGE.

EXAMINATION OF THE TAIL ROTOR REVEALED THAT THE GEARBOX WAS INTACT AND DID NOT BIND WHEN MANUALLY ROTATED.  BOTH TAIL ROTOR BLADES WERE ATTACHED AT THE HUB.  HOWEVER, ONLY ABOUT 7 INCHES OF ONE BLADE REMAINED AND EXHIBITED BROOM STRAW FRACTURES.  THE OTHER BLADE WAS RELATIVELY INTACT, BUT THE TIP EXHIBITED BROOM STRAW FRACTURES, AND THE CAP WAS SEPARATED.  THE OUTBOARD FACE OF THE BLADE EXHIBITED CHORDWISE SCORING OVER THE ENTIRE SURFACE AREA. AT THE TIP, THE PAINT WAS EXFOLIATED AND A GRAY COLORED COMPOSITE MATERIAL WAS EXPOSED.  BOTH PITCH LINKS WERE INTACT, BUT THE OUTBOARD TIPS EXHIBITED SCORING.  ONE OF THE TAIL ROTOR OUTBOARD COMPENSATING WEIGHTS WAS BENT, AND THE OTHER WAS BROKEN OFF AT THE ARM.

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

AN AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED ON THE PILOT ON JANUARY 18, 2002, BY THE CUYAHOGA COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE, CLEVELAND, OHIO.

THE FAA TOXICOLOGICAL ACCIDENT RESEARCH LABORATORY, OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, PERFORMED A TOXICOLOGICAL EXAMINATION ON THE PILOT.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

REVIEW OF THE BK-117A-3 FLIGHT MANUAL, PAGE 2-8, STATED, ""DIRECTIONAL CONTROLLABILITY DURING TAKE-OFF AND LANDING IS ASSURED FOR FLIGHT CONDITION WITH CROSSWIND COMPONENTS UP TO 17 [KNOTS].""

DURING EXAMINATION OF THE HELIPORT ENVIRONMENT, IT WAS OBSERVED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT THE WINDSOCK MOUNTED ON THE ROOF OF THE 10-FOOT HIGH BUILDING AND ON TOP OF THE 16-FLOOR BUILDING FREQUENTLY INDICATED DIFFERENT WIND SPEEDS AND DIRECTIONS. 

EXAMINATION OF AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN WITHIN SEVERAL MINUTES OF EACH OTHER ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT ALSO REVEALED THE WINDSOCKS INDICATING DIFFERENT WIND SPEEDS AND DIRECTIONS. IN ONE PHOTOGRAPH, THE WINDSOCK ON THE 10-FOOT HIGH BUILDING APPEARED HALFWAY EXTENDED AND INDICATED WIND OUT OF THE EAST-SOUTHEAST.  THE WINDSOCK MOUNTED ON THE 16-FLOOR BUILDING APPEARED FULLY EXTENDED, AND INDICATED WIND OUT OF THE NORTHWEST.  IN A SECOND PHOTOGRAPH, THE WINDSOCK MOUNTED ON THE 10-FOOT HIGH BUILDING WAS LIMP, AND THE WINDSOCK MOUNTED ON THE 16-FLOOR BUILDING APPEARED TO BE FULLY EXTENDED AND INDICATED WINDS OUT OF THE NORTHWEST.

ADDITIONALLY, A HANDHELD ANEMOMETER WAS USED TO REGISTER WIND SPEED AND FORCE ON THE PRIMARY HELIPAD.  OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL MINUTES, RAPID CHANGES IN WIND SPEEDS WERE NOTED.

ACCORDING TO THE OPERATOR'S DIRECTOR OF SAFETY, AN ANEMOMETER HAD BEEN INSTALLED ON THE ROOF OF THE 16-FLOOR BUILDING TO ASSIST A CRANE DURING CONSTRUCTION OF THE HELIPORT.  UPON COMPLETION OF THE CONSTRUCTION, THE ANEMOMETER REMAINED INSTALLED BUT WAS DISCONNECTED.  AFTER THE ACCIDENT, THE ANEMOMETER WAS RECONFIGURED, AND A THIRD WINDSOCK WAS INSTALLED ON THE ROOF OF THE HOSPITAL'S STABILIZATION BUILDING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL WIND INFORMATION TO PILOTS ARRIVING AND DEPARTING THE HELIPORT.

THE HELICOPTER WRECKAGE WAS RELEASED TO THE OPERATOR ON JANUARY 31, 2002.","THE MEDEVAC HELICOPTER LIFTED OFF THE HOSPITAL'S ROOF-TOP HELIPAD AT NIGHT.  THE PILOT MADE A RIGHT PEDAL TURN TO THE NORTHWEST, FACING A BUILDING THAT EXTENDED ABOVE THE HEIGHT OF THE HELIPAD BY APPROXIMATELY 10-FEET.  THE PARAMEDIC SAID THAT WHEN THE HELICOPTER WAS ABOUT 20-FEET ABOVE THE HELIPAD, AND WHILE HE WAS PROGRAMMING THE GPS RECEIVER, A ""SUDDEN GUST"" OF WIND PUSH THE HELICOPTER FROM DIRECTLY BEHIND.  HE WAS NOT ALERTED TO ANYTHING UNUSUAL UNTIL HE LOOKED UP AND NOTICED THE HELICOPTER'S CLOSE PROXIMITY TO A 16-FLOOR BRICK BUILDING, LOCATED AT THE NORTHERN CORNER OF THE HELIPORT, WHICH EXTENDED ABOVE THE HEIGHT OF THE HELIPAD BY 4 FLOORS.  THE PARAMEDIC YELLED, ""BUILDING, BUILDING, BUILDING!"" TO ALERT THE PILOT.  THE PILOT THEN MADE A RAPID RIGHT CYCLIC INPUT TO AVOID HITTING THE BUILDING, BUT THE HELICOPTER STRUCK THE BUILDING, AND FELL ABOUT 13 FLOORS TO GROUND LEVEL.  THE PARAMEDIC DID NOT SEE OR HEAR ANY WARNING LIGHTS, HORNS OR UNUSUAL NOISES, AND WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY MECHANICAL PROBLEMS WITH THE HELICOPTER.  A POLICE OFFICER WHO FLEW TWO MISSIONS IN THE LOCAL AREA PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT SAID THE WIND SPEED AT 500 FEET AGL WAS AT LEAST 25 KNOTS AND GUSTING FROM THE SOUTH/SOUTHWEST.  HE STOOD ON THE PRIMARY HELIPAD AFTER THE ACCIDENT AND SAID MECHANICAL TURBULENCE FROM THE BUILDING WAS EVIDENT.  AN FAA INSPECTOR WHO ALSO STOOD ON THE ROOFTOP HELIPAD AFTER THE ACCIDENT SAID THE WIND GUSTS WERE ABOUT 20-30 KNOTS FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND THEY SWIRLED AROUND THE HELIPORT.  REVIEW OF THE HELICOPTER FLIGHT MANUAL REVEALED, ""DIRECTIONAL CONTROLLABILITY DURING TAKE-OFF AND LANDING IS ASSURED FOR FLIGHT CONDITION WITH CROSSWIND COMPONENTS UP TO 17 [KNOTS].","PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL OF THE HELICOPTER WHILE HOVERING, WHICH RESULTED IN ITS COLLISION WITH A BUILDING.  FACTORS WERE THE CONFINED AREA, TAIL WIND, AND WIND GUSTS."

ON JUNE 21, 2002, AT 1207 CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME, A EUROCOPTER AS-350-B2, N852HW, OPERATED BY ROCKY MOUNTAIN HOLDINGS LLC (RMH), AS LIFENET FLIGHT 12, EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF CONTROL AND COLLISION WITH THE TERRAIN AT THE KARL STEFAN MEMORIAL AIRPORT (OFK), NORFOLK, NEBRASKA.  THE COMMERCIAL RATED PILOT, PARAMEDIC, AND FLIGHT NURSE WERE ALL FATALLY INJURED.  THE TITLE 14 CFR PART 91 FLIGHT WAS OPERATING IN VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS ON A COMPANY FLIGHT PLAN.  THE FLIGHT ORIGINATED FROM THE HELIPAD AT THE FAITH REGIONAL WEST HOSPITAL (NE68), IN NORFOLK, NEBRASKA, AT 1200.

N852HW WAS BASED AT THE FAITH REGIONAL HEALTH SERVICES WEST CAMPUS HELIPORT (NE68) IN NORFOLK, NEBRASKA.  NE68 IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILES NORTH-NORTHWEST FROM OFK.

THE PURPOSE OF THE FLIGHT WAS TO FLY TO ST. ANTHONY'S HOSPITAL IN O'NEILL, NEBRASKA, TO PICK UP A PATIENT.  THE PATIENT WAS THEN GOING TO BE TRANSPORTED TO THE MERCY MEDICAL CENTER IN SIOUX CITY, IOWA.  AT 1152:46, THE PILOT WAS INFORMED OF THE MISSION BY LIFECOM DISPATCH.  AT 1201:20, THE PILOT RADIOED THE LIFECOM DISPATCHER AND REPORTED THAT HE HAD DEPARTED.  AT 1203:25, THE PILOT REPORTED TO DISPATCH THAT HE WAS GOING TO LAND AT OFK, AND HE ASKED THE DISPATCHER TO CONTACT THEIR MECHANIC AND HAVE HIM MEET THE AIRCRAFT.  HE REPORTED ""WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LAND AND GET SOMETHING CHECKED OUT WITH MAINTENANCE BEFORE WE CAN TAKE THIS MISSION.""  THE DISPATCHER BEGAN THE PROCESS OF LOCATING THE MECHANIC.  AT 1205:10, THE PILOT INFORMED THE DISPATCHER THAT THEY WERE EXPERIENCING ""BINDING IN THE RIGHT PEDAL.""  THIS WAS THE LAST TRANSMISSION BETWEEN THE HELICOPTER AND DISPATCH.  

SEVERAL WITNESSES REPORTED SEEING THE HELICOPTER JUST PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.  

THE PERSON MONITORING THE UNICOM RADIO AT THE KARL STEFAN AIRPORT REPORTED THAT THE PILOT OF N852HW MADE A RADIO CALL SAYING HE WAS INBOUND FOR LANDING.  SHE STATED SHE RESPONDED TO THE CALL AND ASKED IF THEY WERE GOING TO NEED FUEL.  THERE WAS NO RESPONSE TO HER INQUIRY.  SHE STATED SHE THEN SAW THE HELICOPTER HOVERING OVER THE RAMP, ABOUT 10 FEET OFF THE GROUND, AND THOUGHT HE WAS GONG TO LAND.  SHE STATED SHE ANSWERED THE TELEPHONE AND SECONDS LATER WHEN SHE LOOKED BACK OUT THE WINDOW SHE NOTICED THE HELICOPTER HAD CRASHED.

 THE PILOT OF AN AIRPLANE THAT WAS LANDING AT OFK REPORTED THAT HE WAS ENTERING THE TRAFFIC PATTERN FOR RUNWAY 19 WHEN HE HEARD THE HELICOPTER REPORT BEING NORTH OF THE CITY, LANDING TO THE SOUTH.  HE STATED THAT HE ASKED THE HELICOPTER THREE TIMES FOR A POSITION REPORT, BUT HE DID NOT GET A RESPONSE.  HE STATED THAT WHEN HE WAS ON A ONE MILE FINAL, HE SAW THE HELICOPTER ""HIGH RIGHT [THE WITNESSES RIGHT], DESCENDING ACROSS TO LOW LEFT [THE WITNESSES LEFT] VIEW (AT A HIGH RATE OF DESCENT).""  THE HELICOPTER PASSED BETWEEN HIS AIRCRAFT AND THE RUNWAY THRESHOLD.  HE STATED HE ABORTED HIS LANDING TO AVOID THE HELICOPTER.  WHEN HE WAS TURNING CROSSWIND, HE SAW THE HELICOPTER DESCEND TOWARD THE NORTH END OF THE RAMP AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS LANDING.  HE TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO FLYING HIS AIRPLANE AND WHEN HE LOOKED BACK TOWARD THE HELICOPTER HE SAW IT ""CRASHING ON ITS SIDE AND COMING TO REST.""

A WITNESS WHO WAS TRAVELING SOUTH ON HIGHWAY 81 REPORTED SEEING THE HELICOPTER HOVERING OVER THE NORTHERN QUADRANT OF THE AIRPORT.  HE LOST SIGHT OF THE HELICOPTER, AND THEN SAW IT CLIMB TO A HEIGHT OF ABOUT 100 TO 200 FEET WHERE IT LEVELED OFF AND HOVERED.  HE REPORTED, ""IT SUDDENLY BEGAN TO SPIN (I BELIEVE COUNTER-CLOCKWISE, BUT UPON REFLECTION, I'M NOT POSITIVE) WITH ITS NOSE ANGLED DOWN, AND A MOMENT LATER IT STARTED TO DESCEND RAPIDLY, STILL SPINNING, APPARENTLY OUT OF CONTROL.  AFTER SEVERAL COMPLETE REVOLUTIONS, THE HELICOPTER DOVE TO THE GROUND, COMING TO REST ON ITS RIGHT SIDE.""  THIS WITNESS WENT TO THE HELICOPTER TO HELP.  HE REPORTED HEARING AN ""OCCASIONAL RELEASE OF PRESSURE FROM WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS, AND FROM TIME TO TIME THERE WOULD BE A BRIEF PUFF OF SMOKE FROM THE EXHAUST.""     

ANOTHER WITNESS WHO WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY A QUARTER-MILE NORTHWEST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER STOPPED FOR A SHORT TIME AND HOVERED OVER HIS LOCATION.  HE REPORTED THAT AS THE HELICOPTER PROCEEDED TO THE AIRPORT ""IT PITCHED SIDE WAYS AND THE PILOT HIT THE POWER AND GOT THE HELICOPTER BACK UP IN THE AIR.""  HE REPORTED THE HELICOPTER THEN BEGAN TO SPIN CLOCKWISE (LOOKING DOWN FROM THE TOP).  HE STATED THE SPIN SLOWED AS THE HELICOPTER GAINED ALTITUDE THEN IT ""DOVE FORWARD AND DOWN INTO THE GROUND.""

ANOTHER WITNESS WHO WAS AT THE INTERSECTION OF HIGHWAY 81 AND SHERWOOD ROAD REPORTED SEEING THE HELICOPTER ABOUT 70 FEET SOUTHWEST OF THE 2 NORTH BUILDINGS AT THE AIRPORT AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 30 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND WITH ITS NOSE POINTED TO THE EAST.  THE NOSE OF THE HELICOPTER WAS AT AN ANGLE, WHICH WAS ABOUT 30 DEGREES LOWER THAN THE TAIL.  THE WITNESS STATED THE TAIL SWUNG ABOUT 3 TIMES FROM THE NORTHWEST TO THE SOUTHWEST AND THE NOSE OF THE HELICOPTER REMAINED IN THE SAME POSITION.  THE HELICOPTER THEN VEERED TO THE LEFT.  BUILDINGS BLOCKED HIS VIEW AND THE NEXT THING HE SAW WAS A CLOUD OF DUST.

ANOTHER WITNESS REPORTED SEEING THE HELICOPTER PRIOR TO IT REACHING THE AIRPORT.  SHE STATED THAT IT WAS ""ROCKING (NOSE TO TAIL) AND GOING IN A CIRCLE, IT WAS NOT SPINNING WHEN I SAW IT.""

A WITNESS DRIVING SOUTH ON HIGHWAY 81 REPORTED SEEING THE HELICOPTER CLIMBING OUT FROM THE AIRPORT AND THOUGHT IT WAS TAKING OFF.  SHE STATED IT REACHED AN ALTITUDE ABOUT TWICE THE HEIGHT OF THE BUILDINGS (HANGARS) AT WHICH TIME IT STARTED TO SPIRAL.  SHE STATED THE HELICOPTER THEN TURNED AND DOVE NOSE FIRST INTO THE GROUND.  

A WITNESS TRAVELING NORTH ON HIGHWAY 81 REPORTED HE THOUGHT THE HELICOPTER WAS TAKING OFF PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.  HE REPORTED THE HELICOPTER THEN STARTED TO FLY ""STRANGELY"" PRIOR TO IT IMPACTING THE GROUND.  

ANOTHER WITNESS REPORTED SEEING THE HELICOPTER IN A LEVEL ATTITUDE AND TRAVELING VERY SLOW AS IT APPROACHED THE AIRPORT.  SHE STATED THE HELICOPTER BANKED A LITTLE WHEN IT GOT CLOSE TO THE HANGARS.  IT STARTED SPINNING COUNTERCLOCKWISE THEN IT BEGAN TO SPIN IN A CLOCKWISE DIRECTION.  SHE STATED THE HELICOPTER DESCENDED AND CLIMBED BACK UP AT WHICH TIME SHE WAS DISTRACTED.  SHE THEN SAW THE HELICOPTER DIVE INTO THE GROUND.  SHE STATED THE HELICOPTER WAS ABOUT TWICE THE HEIGHT OF THE BUILDINGS WHEN IT STARTED SPINNING.

 AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER WAS A SINGLE ENGINE MULTIPURPOSE EUROCOPTER AS350B2, S/N 2630.  THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES TURN CLOCKWISE AS VIEWED FROM THE TOP.  THEREFORE, THE RIGHT TAIL ROTOR CONTROL PEDAL IS USED TO OVER COME THE EFFECTS OF TORQUE GENERATED BY THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES.  THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES ON MOST UNITED STATES MANUFACTURED HELICOPTERS ROTATE COUNTER-CLOCKWISE AS VIEWED FROM THE TOP.  

N852HW WAS ISSUED AN AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATE ON JULY 27, 1992.  IN OCTOBER 1992, THE HELICOPTER WAS OPERATED BY MEMPHIS MEDICAL AIRAMBULANCE SERVICE, INC., FROM 1992 UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1999, AT WHICH TIME IT WAS RETURNED TO AMERICAN EUROCOPTER.  RMH PURCHASED THE HELICOPTER IN MARCH 3, 2000, WHEN IT HAD A TOTAL TIME OF 4,280 HOURS.

N852HW WAS BEING MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN APPROVED AIRCRAFT INSPECTION PROGRAM (AAIP).  ACCORDING TO THE LOGBOOKS, AN ""A"" CHECK WAS PERFORMED ON THE AIRFRAME ON JUNE 15, 2002, AT A TOTAL AIRFRAME TIME OF 5,543.2 HOURS.

THE ENGINE, A TURBOMECA ARRIEL 1, S/N 9221, WAS MANUFACTURED ON JANUARY 30, 1992.  THE ENGINE WAS INSTALLED IN 3 OTHER HELICOPTERS PRIOR TO BEING INSTALLED IN N852HW, ON APRIL 28, 1998.  THE ENGINE HAD A TOTAL TIME OF 3,460.8 HOURS WHEN IT WAS INSTALLED IN N852HW.  THE AIRFRAME TOTAL TIME AT ENGINE INSTALLATION WAS 2,998.36 HOURS.  ON JUNE 15, 2002, ""W"" AND ""X"" CHECKS WERE PERFORMED AT A TOTAL ENGINE TIME OF 6,004.7 HOURS.

ACCORDING TO MAINTENANCE RECORDS, ON JUNE 21, 2002, THE HOBBS TIME WAS RECORDED AS 4,391.7 HOURS, AIRCRAFT TOTAL TIME WAS RECORDED AS 5,562 HOURS, AND THE ENGINE TOTAL TIME WAS 6,023.5 HOURS.

THE MECHANIC ASSIGNED TO N852HW STATED THAT ON JUNE 19, 2002, HE AND THE ACCIDENT PILOT FLEW THE HELICOPTER FROM NORFOLK TO LINCOLN, NEBRASKA, TO HAVE SOME AVIONICS WORK DONE.  SHORTLY AFTER THEY TOOK OFF ON THEIR RETURN FLIGHT, SMOKE FILLED THE CABIN.  THEY RETURNED TO LINCOLN AND DISCOVERED THE AIR CONDITIONER COMPRESSOR HAD LOCKED UP AND THE BELT WAS BURNED.  THE MECHANIC CHANGED THE BELT AND WHEN HE WAS CLOSING THE COWLING THE HYDRAULIC PUMP BELT SNAPPED.  THE MECHANIC STATED THE BELT SNAPPED BECAUSE IT WAS LOCATED NEAR THE LOCKED UP COMPRESSOR AND IT HAD BEEN HEATED.  THE MECHANIC CHANGED THE HYDRAULIC PUMP BELT AND THEY FLEW THE HELICOPTER BACK TO NORFOLK WITHOUT INCIDENT.

UPON LANDING AT NORFOLK, THE HELICOPTER WAS REFUELED WITH 25 GALLONS OF JET A FUEL.  THE HELICOPTER WAS THEN FLOWN TO NE68 WHERE IT REMAINED UNTIL DEPARTING ON THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT.

THE MECHANIC STATED THAT ON THE MORNING OF THE ACCIDENT, HE WENT TO THE HOSPITAL AND PERFORMED HIS DAILY INSPECTION/PREFLIGHT OF THE HELICOPTER.  HE THEN MET WITH THE PILOT AS HE WAS BEGINNING HIS SHIFT.  THEY DISCUSSED THE STATUS OF THE HELICOPTER AND THE PILOT CONDUCTED HIS OWN PREFLIGHT INSPECTION.  THE MECHANIC REPORTED THAT THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING MAINTENANCE ISSUES WITH THE HELICOPTER.

THE PILOT COMPLETED WEIGHT AND BALANCE CALCULATIONS PRIOR TO THE FLIGHT.  THE TOTAL WEIGHT WAS CALCULATED TO BE 4,658.8 POUNDS WITH A CENTER OF GRAVITY (CG) OF 128.7 INCHES.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD'S (NTSB) ON-SCENE INVESTIGATION BEGAN ON JUNE 22, 2002.

THE MAIN WRECKAGE WAS LOCATED AT THE EDGE OF TAXIWAY ""A"", JUST SOUTH OF THE RUN UP PAD NEAR THE APPROACH END OF RUNWAY 19.  THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST ON ITS RIGHT SIDE WITH THE TAIL ROTOR ON THE TAXIWAY AND THE NOSE OF THE HELICOPTER ON THE GRASS.  THE NOSE OF THE HELICOPTER WAS POINTING TO A MAGNETIC HEADING OF 215 DEGREES.

THE FIRST IMPACT MARK ALONG THE WRECKAGE PATH WAS AT THE EDGE OF THE TAXIWAY APPROXIMATELY 40 FEET SOUTHEAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  THE FORWARD PORTION OF THE LEFT SKID WAS FOUND AT THIS IMPACT POINT.

APPROXIMATELY 25 FEET AFTER THE FIRST IMPACT, TWO SLASH MARKS AND A GOUGE WERE LOCATED ON THE TAXIWAY.  THE TOTAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THE FIRST SLASH, SECOND SLASH, AND THE GOUGE WAS 3 FEET 7 INCHES.  THESE MARKS LINED UP ALONG THE WRECKAGE PATH WITH THE FINAL RESTING POSITION OF THE TAIL ROTOR.  THE MARKS CONTAI","THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED THE TERRAIN FOLLOWING A LOSS OF CONTROL.  SHORTLY AFTER DEPARTING THE HOSPITAL ON A MEDIVAC FLIGHT, THE PILOT REQUESTED THAT COMPANY DISPATCH HAVE THE COMPANY MECHANIC MEET HIM AT A NEARBY AIRPORT BECAUSE HE WAS EXPERIENCING ""BINDING IN THE RIGHT PEDAL.""  AN AIRPORT EMPLOYEE STATED THAT JUST PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT, SHE SAW THE HELICOPTER HOVERING OVER THE RAMP AND THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO LAND.  FOUR OTHER WITNESSES REPORTED SEEING THE HELICOPTER CLIMBING AND THOUGHT IT WAS TAKING OFF.  WITNESSES ALSO REPORTED SEEING THE HELICOPTER SPINNING (DIRECTIONS VARY) PRIOR TO IT DESCENDING TO IMPACT.  ONE WITNESS REPORTED THE NOSE OF THE HELICOPTER WAS STATIONARY ON AN EAST HEADING AND THE TAIL OF THE HELICOPTER WAS SWINGING BACK AND FORTH.  HE STATED THE HELICOPTER THEN VEERED TO THE LEFT AND HE LOST SIGHT OF IT WHEN HE TRAVELED BEHIND SOME BUILDINGS.  ANOTHER WITNESS REPORTED SEEING THE HELICOPTER ROCKING NOSE TO TAIL AND GOING IN A CIRCLE, BUT NOT SPINNING, PRIOR TO IMPACT.  INSPECTION OF THE HELICOPTER REVEALED ONE OF THE SCUFF SLEEVES ON THE TAIL ROTOR PITCH CHANGE ROD WAS MOVED APPROXIMATELY 3 INCHES AFT OF THE BEARING BRACKET.  THE TOP OF THE SLEEVE WAS GOUGED AND SCUFFED.  BOTH THE FORWARD AND AFT ENDS OF THE SLEEVE WERE SLIGHTLY CURLED AWAY FROM THE ROD.  THE FORWARD EDGE OF THE SLEEVE WAS TORN.  NO OTHER MECHANICAL FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OF THE ENGINE, AIRFRAME, OR SYSTEMS WERE IDENTIFIED THAT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN THE ACCIDENT.  THE GUARDED HYDRAULIC CUT OFF SWITCH WAS FOUND IN THE OFF POSITION.  RECORDS SHOW THE PILOT HAD APPROXIMATELY 2,500 HOURS OF HELICOPTER TIME WITH A TOTAL OF 43.8 HOURS OF FLIGHT TIME IN THIS MAKE AND MODEL OF HELICOPTER.  WINDS AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WERE FROM 200 DEGREES AT 16 KNOTS, GUSTING TO 21 KNOTS.  THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION ROTORCRAFT FLYING HANDBOOK STATES THAT A LOSS OF TAIL ROTOR EFFECTIVENESS ""MAY OCCUR IN ALL SINGLE-ROTOR HELICOPTERS AT AIRSPEEDS LESS THEN 30 KNOTS.  IT IS THE RESULT OF THE TAIL ROTOR NOT PROVING ADEQUATE THRUST TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL, AND IS USUALLY CAUSED BE EITHER CERTAIN WIND AZIMUTHS (DIRECTIONS) WHILE HOVERING, OR BY AN INSUFFICIENT TAIL ROTOR THRUST FOR A GIVEN POWER SETTING AT HIGH ALTITUDES.""","A LOSS OF TAIL ROTOR EFFECTIVENESS AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE HELICOPTER.  FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCIDENT WERE THE BINDING OF THE TAIL ROTOR PITCH CHANGED ROD, THE GUSTY WIND CONDITIONS, AND THE PILOT’S LACK OF TOTAL EXPERIENCE IN THIS MAKE AND MODEL OF HELICOPTER."

THE CERTIFICATED COMMERCIAL PILOT WAS FATALLY INJURED.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED, AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE EXTERNAL LOAD FLIGHT CONDUCTED UNDER 14 CFR PART 133.

ACCORDING TO A MASSACHUSETTS AERONAUTICS COMMISSION INSPECTOR, THE PILOT HAD MADE NUMEROUS LIFTS ON THE MORNING OF THE ACCIDENT, WITH THE SIMILAR CRANBERRY LOADS, INTO THE WIND, AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION.  THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED DURING A FIRST LIFT IN A NEW LOCATION.  

A FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) INSPECTOR PERFORMED AN ON-SCENE EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER AND INTERVIEWED WITNESSES. ACCORDING TO THE INSPECTOR, WITNESSES STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS HOVERING APPROXIMATELY 12 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND WITH A LEFT QUARTERING TAILWIND (BETWEEN 5-7 KNOTS) WHEN THE GROUND CREW SECURED A 900-POUND CARGO BASKET FILLED WITH CRANBERRIES TO A 15-FOOT LONG SLING LOAD LINE.  WHEN THE CARGO BASKET WAS BEING SECURED, THE HELICOPTER WAS POSITIONED FORWARD OF THE LOAD.  ONCE THE LOAD WAS SECURED AND THE GROUND CREW WAS CLEAR OF THE HELICOPTER, THE HELICOPTER FLEW FORWARD AND DRAGGED THE CARGO BASKET BEHIND.  THE CARGO BASKET THEN COLLIDED WITH A DITCH AND THE PILOT JETTISONED THE LOAD.  AFTER THE PILOT RELEASED THE LOAD, THE HELICOPTER PITCHED UP, THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES SEVERED THE TAIL BOOM, AND THE MAIN ROTOR ASSEMBLY SEPARATED FROM THE HELICOPTER.  THE HELICOPTER FELL ABOUT 15 FEET TO THE GROUND, AND ROLLED OVER ON TO ITS LEFT SIDE.

THE INSPECTOR SAID THAT THERE WERE NO OBSTRUCTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE IMPEDED THE HELICOPTER FROM DEPARTING INTO THE WIND.

IN A WRITTEN STATEMENT, A WITNESS, WHO WAS HARVESTING CRANBERRIES, HEARD A ""LARGE POP"", SIMILAR TO THE SOUND OF  SEMI-AUTOMATIC HANDGUN, BUT MAGNIFIED.  HE THEN LOOKED UP, AND OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER PITCH FORWARD, FACING NORTH-NORTHEAST, ABOUT 16-20 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.  THE WITNESS REPORTED SEEING SMOKE OR DEBRIS EXITING THE REAR, LEFT SIDE OF THE HELICOPTER. 

ANOTHER WITNESS REPORTED SEEING A FOOT-LONG FLAME COMING OUT OF THE LEFT EXHAUST PIPE, FOLLOWED BY AN EXPLOSION.  THE HELICOPTER THEN ""LEANED"" TO THE RIGHT, AND FELL ABOUT 15 FEET TO THE GROUND.  IT THEN SHREDDED PARTS, AND ROLLED ON TO ITS LEFT SIDE.

THE MAIN ROTOR ASSEMBLY CAME TO REST ABOUT 58 FEET FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  THE TAIL BOOM, WHICH INCLUDED THE VERTICAL FIN, TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX AND TAIL ROTOR ASSEMBLY, CAME TO REST APPROXIMATELY 105 FEET FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  EXAMINATION OF THE TAIL ROTOR BLADES REVEALED THAT ONE BLADE WAS NOT DAMAGED, AND THE OTHER BLADE EXHIBITED MINOR DAMAGE. 

EXAMINATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR ASSEMBLY REVEALED THAT IT HAD SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN ROTOR MAST BELOW THE CONTACT AREAS FOR THE STATIC STOPS.  THERE WAS ALSO EVIDENCE OF MAST BUMPING.

THE PILOT'S CYCLIC WAS BROKEN OFF AT THE BASE, THE COLLECTIVE WAS IN THE FULL DOWN POSITION, AND THE THROTTLE WAS IN THE FULL OPEN POSITION.

APPROXIMATELY 20 GALLONS OF FUEL REMAINED IN THE FUEL TANK, AND THE ENGINE TORQUE METER GAUGE INDICATED 80 PERCENT.

EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED THERE WAS SOME POST IMPACT DAMAGE TO THE COMPRESSOR, BUT IT SPUN FREELY.  THE GAS GENERATOR SECTION ALSO SPUN FREELY.  

THE PILOT HELD A COMMERCIAL CERTIFICATE WITH RATINGS FOR ROTORCRAFT-HELICOPTER, AND AIRPLANE SINGLE ENGINE LAND, MULTI-ENGINE LAND, AND INSTRUMENT AIRPLANE.  HE WAS ALSO A CERTIFIED FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR WITH RATINGS FOR ROTORCRAFT-HELICOPTER AND AIRPLANE SINGLE ENGINE LAND.

HIS MOST RECENT FAA SECOND CLASS MEDICAL WAS ISSUED ON MARCH 15, 2002.  AT THAT TIME, HE REPORTED A TOTAL OF 7,675 FLIGHT HOURS.  THE FAA REPORTED THE PILOT HAD 4,000 FLIGHT HOURS IN MAKE AND MODEL.

WEATHER AT NEW BEDFORD REGIONAL AIRPORT (EWB), NEW BEDFORD, MASSACHUSETTS, ABOUT 6 MILES WEST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, AT 1153, INCLUDED WINDS FROM 200 DEGREES AT 8 KNOTS, 8 MILES VISIBILITY, AND CLEAR SKIES.","THE PILOT MADE NUMEROUS SUCCESSFUL LIFTS INTO THE WIND, WITH SIMILAR CRANBERRY LOADS.  THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST LIFT ATTEMPT AT A NEW LOCATION.

ON JANUARY 16, 2003, AT 0826 CENTRAL STANDARD TIME, A BELL 206L-1, N3194P, OPERATED BY AIR LOGISTICS LLC, WAS DESTROYED ON IMPACT WITH AN OFFSHORE PLATFORM DURING LANDING.  A POST CRASH FIRE ENSUED.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.  THE 14 CFR PART 135 BUSINESS FLIGHT WAS OPERATING ON A COMPANY FLIGHT PLAN.  THE COMMERCIAL PILOT AND TWO PASSENGERS WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED, AND THE THIRD PASSENGER WAS FATALLY INJURED.  THE FLIGHT DEPARTED FROM AIR LOGISTICS (VENICE) N HELIPORT (45LA), VENICE, LOUISIANA, AT 0816, EN ROUTE TO THE PLATFORM.

COMPANY RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE PILOT BEGAN HIS DUTY DAY AT 0500 AND FLEW TWO FLIGHTS IN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT. HE DEPARTED FROM 45LA AT 0708 AND ARRIVED AT MP133 AT 0744.  HE THEN DEPARTED AT 0744 AND RETURNED TO 45LA AT 0816.  HE THEN DEPARTED ON THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT TO BRETON SOUND 53.

ACCORDING TO NATIONAL SAFETY TRANSPORTATION BOARD (NTSB) FORM 6120.1/2 SUBMITTED BY THE PILOT'S ATTORNEY, THE PILOT REPORTED:

""I NOTED THE POSITION OF THE WINDSOCK.  THE TAIL OF THE WINDSOCK WAS POINTING TOWARD THE NORTH.  I ALSO OBSERVED THE DIRECTION OF THE 'WIND STREAKS' ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER, WHICH SUPPORTED THE INDICATIONS OF THE WINDSOCK.  I ESTIMATED THE WIND TO BE LIGHT (APPROX. 5 KNOTS) COMING OUT OF THE SOUTH, THE SKY WAS CLEAR, VISIBILITY UNRESTRICTED, AND WEATHER WAS NOT A FACTOR.  I COMPLETED THE BEFORE LANDING CHECKLIST UPON ENTERING THE DOWNWIND LEG.  ABEAM THE PLATFORM I STARTED A SLOW DESCENT AND A RIGHT HAND TURN, ROLLING OUT OF THE TURN AS I INTERCEPTED THE FINAL APPROACH PATH TO THE PLATFORM, UTILIZING AIRLOG'S STANDARD ""PINNACLE"" APPROACH.  I CONTINUED THE APPROACH TO THE SOUTH, INTO THE WIND, ON A RELATIVELY SHALLOW FINAL APPROACH (STANDARD FOR A ""PINNACLE"" STYLE LANDING).  THROUGHOUT THE APPROACH I CONTINUOUSLY SCANNED MY INSTRUMENTS, PARTICULARLY THE VERTICAL VELOCITY INDICATOR (VVI), WHICH CONFIRMED 500 FEET PER MINUTE DESCENT.  THE 500 FEET PER MINUTE DESCENT WAS NORMAL FOR THIS TYPE OF APPROACH.  THE APPROACH PROCEEDED NORMALLY UNTIL I CROSSED OVER THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM, AT WHICH POINT THE HELICOPTER SUDDENLY DESCENDED BELOW THE APPROACH PATH I WAS FLYING.  AT THIS TIME I INITIATED AN INCREASE IN POWER EVENTUALLY REACHING 100% TORQUE WHICH WAS INEFFECTIVE IN ARRESTING THE DESCENT.  GIVEN THE WEATHER CONDITIONS, GROSS WEIGHT AND POWER AVAILABLE ACCORDING TO MANUFACTURERS SPECIFICATIONS (SEE ATTACHED OUT OF GROUND EFFECT HOVER POWER CHART EXCERPTED FROM THE FLIGHT MANUAL) THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN SUFFICIENT POWER TO ARREST THE SINK RATE.  WITH NO ROOM TO MANEUVER AND NO WAY TO GET CLEAR OF THE PLATFORM, I INCREASED POWER BEYOND 100% IN A FINAL ATTEMPT TO GAIN THE HELIDECK WITH NO RECOVERY OF ALTITUDE.  AT THIS TIME THERE WERE NO OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE AS THE AIRCRAFT BEGAN AN UNCONTROLLED RIGHT-HAND TURN AND THE MAIN OR TAIL ROTOR BLADES STRUCK OBSTACLE ON THE PLATFORM.  THE AIRCRAFT CAME TO REST ON ITS RIGHT HAND SIDE ON THE SUPERSTRUCTURE OF THE PLATFORM.""

ACCORDING TO THE A STATEMENT SUBMITTED BY THE PASSENGER'S EMPLOYER, A PASSENGER REPORTED: 

""WE WERE MAKING OUR FINAL APPROACH TO LAND ON THE HELO-DECK AT BRETON SOUND 53, WHEN I WAS THINKING THAT THE PILOT WAS COMING IN TOO FAST.  HE WAS LOOKING BACK AND FORTH TO CHECK THE LANDING PAD.  THE PILOT IS HOVERING OVER THE PAD AND LOOKING AROUND.  THE TAIL OF THE HELICOPTER WAS LOWERED DURING THE APPROACH.  THE PILOT PUT HER DOWN AND THEN THE HELICOPTER FELT LIKE IT WAS SLIDING OFF THE SIDE OF THE HELIPAD.  THE PILOT TRIED TO GAIN CONTROL BUT IT SEEMED THAT THE RPMS WERE TOO LOW AND THE PILOT COULD NOT RECOVER.  THE MAIN ROTOR THEN STRUCK SOME PIPING MAKING THE HELICOPTER FLIP FROM SIDE TO SIDE.""

AIRPORT INFORMATION

THE BS 53 ""A"" PRODUCTION PLATFORM WAS LOCATED ABOUT 14.6 NM AND 059 DEGREES FROM 45LA.  THE PLATFORM WAS EQUIPPED WITH A WINDSOCK LOCATED SOUTHEAST OF THE LANDING PAD.  THE HEIGHT OF THE WINDSOCK WAS SUCH THAT IT INTERSECTED THE APPROXIMATE PLANE FORMED BY THE HELIDECK.  THE WINDSOCK WAS TATTERED AND ACCORDING TO THE PILOT'S REPORT, ""THE END OF THE WINDSOCK WAS WRAPPED AROUND THE POLE.""


WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE WRECKAGE DIAGRAM, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE DOCKET OF THIS REPORT, DEPICTS DEBRIS LYING TO THE EAST OF THE HELIDECK AND ON THE PRODUCTION PLATFORM.  THE CABIN AREA, MAIN ROTOR BLADES, AND MAIN ROTOR HUB WERE LYING BETWEEN TWO PLATFORM GENERATORS, WHICH WERE ORIENTED TOWARDS NORTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST.  THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX WAS LYING ALONG THE SOUTHWEST FACE OF THE SOUTHWESTERN GENERATOR.  A MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS NORTH OF THE TWO GENERATORS.  THE WESTERN MOST PIECE OF DEBRIS CONSISTED OF A TAIL ROTOR SECTION.


TESTS AND RESEARCH

THE ENGINE WAS SHIPPED TO ROLLS ROYCE ALLISON IN INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA, FOR A DISASSEMBLY EXAMINATION UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) INSPECTOR.  THE ENGINE WAS COVERED WITH SOOT AND HAD FIRE DAMAGE TO THE EXTERIOR LINES AND WIRING CONSISTENT WITH A POST CRASH FIRE.  DISASSEMBLY OF THE TURBINE SECTION REVEALED THAT THE NUMBER ONE TURBINE WHEEL HAD SOME LIGHT RUB MARKS ON ITS BLADE TIPS AND THE NUMBER THREE NOZZLE HAD SOME LIGHT RUB MARKS ON THE BLADE TRACK AREA, BOTH OF WHICH WERE CONSISTENT WITH ENGINE ROTATION ON IMPACT.  DISASSEMBLY OF THE COMPRESSOR SECTION REVEALED THAT THE COMPRESSOR SHROUD HAD MOLTEN ALUMINUM SPLATTER ON THE INTERIOR CONSISTENT WITH ROTATION DURING THE EXTERIOR FIRE.  THE IMPELLER OF THE COMPRESSOR DID NOT DISPLAY ANY ROTATION MARKS.

THE ROTORCRAFT FLYING HANDBOOK, FAA-H-8083-21, CHAPTER 11, HELICOPTER EMERGENCIES, VORTEX RING STATE (SETTLING WITH POWER), STATES:

""VORTEX RING STATE DESCRIBES AN AERODYNAMIC CONDITION WHERE A HELICOPTER MAY BE IN A VERTICAL DESCENT WITH UP TO MAXIMUM POWER APPLIED, AND LITTLE OR NO CYCLIC AUTHORITY. THE TERM ""SETTLING WITH POWER"" COMES FROM THE FACT THAT HELICOPTER KEEPS SETTLING EVEN THOUGH FULL ENGINE POWER IS APPLIED.

IN A NORMAL OUT-OF-GROUND-EFFECT HOVER, THE HELICOPTER IS ABLE TO REMAIN STATIONARY BY PROPELLING A LARGE MASS OF AIR DOWN THROUGH THE MAIN ROTOR. SOME OF THE AIR IS RECIRCULATED NEAR THE TIPS OF THE BLADES, CURLING UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE ROTOR SYSTEM AND REJOINING THE AIR ENTERING THE ROTOR FROM THE TOP. THIS PHENOMENON IS COMMON TO ALL AIRFOILS AND IS KNOWN AS TIP VORTICES. TIP VORTICES CONSUME ENGINE POWER BUT PRODUCE NO USEFUL LIFT. AS LONG AS THE TIP VORTICES ARE SMALL, THEIR ONLY EFFECT IS A SMALL LOSS IN ROTOR EFFICIENCY. HOWEVER, WHEN THE HELICOPTER BEGINS TO DESCEND VERTICALLY, IT SETTLES INTO ITS OWN DOWNWASH, WHICH GREATLY ENLARGES THE TIP VORTICES. IN THIS VORTEX RING STATE, MOST OF THE POWER DEVELOPED BY THE ENGINE IS WASTED IN ACCELERATING THE AIR IN A DOUGHNUT PATTERN AROUND THE ROTOR.

IN ADDITION, THE HELICOPTER MAY DESCEND AT A RATE THAT EXCEEDS THE NORMAL DOWNWARD INDUCED-FLOW RATE OF THE INNER BLADE SECTIONS. AS A RESULT, THE AIRFLOW OF THE INNER BLADE SECTIONS IS UPWARD RELATIVE TO THE DISC.  THIS PRODUCES A SECONDARY VORTEX RING IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL TIP-VORTICES. THE SECONDARY VORTEX RING IS GENERATED ABOUT THE POINT ON THE BLADE WHERE THE AIRFLOW CHANGES FROM UP TO DOWN. THE RESULT IS AN UNSTEADY TURBULENT FLOW OVER A LARGE AREA OF THE DISC.  ROTOR EFFICIENCY IS LOST EVEN THOUGH POWER IS STILL BEING SUPPLIED FROM THE ENGINE.

A FULLY DEVELOPED VORTEX RING STATE IS CHARACTERIZED BY AN UNSTABLE CONDITION WHERE THE HELICOPTER EXPERIENCES UNCOMMANDED PITCH AND ROLL OSCILLATIONS, HAS LITTLE OR NO CYCLIC AUTHORITY, AND ACHIEVES A DESCENT RATE, WHICH, IF ALLOWED TO DEVELOP, MAY APPROACH 6,000 FEET PER MINUTE.  IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY INCREASED LEVELS OF VIBRATION.

A VORTEX RING STATE MAY BE ENTERED DURING ANY MANEUVER THAT PLACES THE MAIN ROTOR IN A CONDITION OF HIGH UPFLOW AND LOW FORWARD AIRSPEED.  THIS CONDITION IS SOMETIMES SEEN DURING QUICK-STOP TYPE MANEUVERS OR DURING RECOVERIES FROM AUTOROTATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING COMBINATION OF CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY TO CAUSE SETTLING IN A VORTEX RING STATE:

1. A VERTICAL OR NEARLY VERTICAL DESCENT OF AT LEAST 300 FEET PER MINUTE. (ACTUAL CRITICAL RATE DEPENDS ON THE GROSS WEIGHT, R.P.M., DENSITY ALTITUDE, AND OTHER PERTINENT FACTORS.)
2. THE ROTOR SYSTEM MUST BE USING SOME OF THE AVAILABLE ENGINE POWER (FROM 20 TO 100 PERCENT).
3. THE HORIZONTAL VELOCITY MUST BE SLOWER THAN EFFECTIVE TRANSLATIONAL LIFT.

SOME OF THE SITUATIONS THAT ARE CONDUCIVE TO A SETTLING WITH POWER CONDITION ARE: ATTEMPTING TO HOVER OUT OF GROUND EFFECT AT ALTITUDES ABOVE THE HOVERING CEILING OF THE HELICOPTER; ATTEMPTING TO HOVER OUT OF GROUND EFFECT WITHOUT MAINTAINING PRECISE ALTITUDE CONTROL; OR DOWNWIND AND STEEP POWER APPROACHES IN WHICH AIRSPEED IS PERMITTED TO DROP TO NEARLY ZERO.

WHEN RECOVERING FROM A SETTLING WITH POWER CONDITION, THE TENDENCY ON THE PART OF THE PILOT IS TO FIRST TRY TO STOP THE DESCENT BY INCREASING COLLECTIVE PITCH.  HOWEVER, THIS ONLY RESULTS IN INCREASING THE STALLED AREA OF THE ROTOR, THUS INCREASING THE RATE OF DESCENT. SINCE INBOARD PORTIONS OF THE BLADES ARE STALLED, CYCLIC CONTROL IS LIMITED.  RECOVERY IS ACCOMPLISHED BY INCREASING FORWARD SPEED, AND/OR PARTIALLY LOWERING COLLECTIVE PITCH.  IN A FULLY DEVELOPED VORTEX RING STATE, THE ONLY RECOVERY MAY BE TO ENTER AUTOROTATION TO BREAK THE VORTEX RING STATE.  WHEN CYCLIC AUTHORITY IS REGAINED, YOU CAN THEN INCREASE FORWARD AIRSPEED.""

THE PILOT STATED THAT HE WAS PERFORMING A STANDARD PINNACLE APPROACH TO THE HELIPAD.  THE APPROACH WAS DESCRIBED AS NORMAL UNTIL THE HELICOPTER CROSSED OVER THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM, AT WHICH POINT THE HELICOPTER SUDDENLY DESCENDED BELOW THE APPROACH PATH.  HE REPORTED THAT AN INCREASE OF POWER BEYOND 100% TORQUE WAS INEFFECTIVE IN ARRESTING DESCENT RATE.  THE PLATFORM WAS EQUIPPED WITH A WINDSOCK LOCATED TO SOUTHEAST SIDE OF THE LANDING PAD.  THE HEIGHT OF THE WINDSOCK WAS SUCH THAT IT INTERSECTED THE APPROXIMATE PLANE FORMED BY THE HELIDECK.

ANOTHER WITNESS OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER FLY OVERHEAD AND THEN HEAD TOWARD THE BLUFF AFTER WHICH HE HEARD A LOUD ""THUD"" (SNOHOMISH COUNTY INCIDENT REPORT NUMBER SO03-16387).  NONE OF THE WITNESSES REPORTED SEEING ANY EVIDENCE OF UNUSUAL FLIGHT BEHAVIOR.


PERSONNEL INFORMATION

THE PILOT'S FATHER PROVIDED AN ESTIMATED BREAKDOWN OF THE PILOT'S TOTAL FLIGHT TIME.  HE REPORTED A TOTAL OF 4,420 HOURS OF SINGLE AND MULTI-ENGINE FIXED WING TIME AND A TOTAL OF 5,192 HOURS OF COMBINED HELICOPTER AND FIXED WING TIME WITH THE HELICOPTER TIME BROKEN DOWN AS FOLLOWS (REFER TO ATTACHMENT FS-I):

          374 HRS     HUGHES  500D
              2 HRS     ROBINSON R44
          396 HRS     ROBINSON R22

ACCORDING TO RECORDS MAINTAINED BY ROBINSON HELICOPTER, THE PILOT ATTENDED A FLIGHT TRAINING PROGRAM FOR HIS NEWLY ACQUIRED R22 HELICOPTER CONSISTING OF TWO DAYS OF GROUND SCHOOL (6-7 SEPTEMBER 2000) AND ONE DAY (8 SEPTEMBER 2000) OF FLIGHT TRAINING/CHECKOUT WHICH INCLUDED 2 HOURS OF R44 TIME.  THE PILOT REPORTED TO ROBINSON THAT UPON HIS ARRIVAL FOR TRAINING IN SEPTEMBER 2000, HE ALREADY HAD LOGGED 33 HOURS OF R22 TIME AND 2 HOURS OF R44 TIME.  THE TOTAL 396 HOURS OF R22 TIME MINUS THE 33 HOURS PRIOR TO HIS ACQUISITION OF N7190K (363 HOURS) WAS ESTIMATED TO BE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PILOT IN COMMAND TIME THE PILOT LOGGED IN THE R22 AS WELL AS THE APPROXIMATE TOTAL HELICOPTER TIME FOR N7190K. *

ACCORDING TO THE PILOT'S THIRD CLASS MEDICAL ISSUED 23 OCTOBER 2001, THE PILOT WAS ASSESSED WITH A RESTRICTION THAT HE ""MUST WEAR CORRECTIVE LENSES.""  IT WAS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THE PILOT WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS REQUIREMENT AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.


AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

COPIES OF AIRFRAME AND POWERPLANT LOGS FROM N7190K WERE PROVIDED SHOWING THE HELICOPTER'S LAST ANNUAL/100 HOUR INSPECTION BEING CONDUCTED ON 26 FEBRUARY 2003, AT A TOTAL AIRFRAME/ENGINE TIME OF 308.8 HOURS.  A REVIEW OF THE COPIES SHOWED NO INDIVIDUAL OR REPETITIVE MAINTENANCE PROBLEMS.  THE TOTAL TIME ON BOTH THE ENGINE AND AIRFRAME WERE ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE PILOT'S R22 PILOT IN COMMAND TIME (363 HOURS). *


METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

AVIATION SURFACE WEATHER OBSERVATIONS RECORDED AT SNOHOMISH COUNTY AIRPORT (PAINE FIELD [PAE]) INDICATED A CONSISTENT VISIBILITY OF 10 MILES ALL MORNING AND AFTERNOON OF THE ACCIDENT AND A CONSISTENT ALTIMETER SETTING (ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE) OF 30.11 INCHES OF MERCURY ALL MORNING.  THE 1053 SURFACE WEATHER OBSERVATION REPORTED WINDS VARIABLE AT FOUR KNOTS WITH A TEMPERATURE OF 19 DEGREES CELSIUS.  PAINE FIELD BEARS 10 NAUTICAL MILES SOUTH OF THE ACCIDENT SITE AND IS 606 FEET ABOVE MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL).


WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER CRASHED ON A BLUFF (PLATEAU) SLIGHTLY LESS THAN ONE MILE NORTHWEST OF TULALIP, WASHINGTON.  THE ACCIDENT SITE COORDINATES WERE DETERMINED USING A HAND HELD GPS UNIT AND WERE FOUND TO BE 48 DEGREES 04.457 MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE AND 122 DEGREES 18.112 MINUTES WEST LONGITUDE. THE ELEVATION OF THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS APPROXIMATELY 260 FEET MSL.  REFER TO CHARTS I AND II.

THE PLATEAU ON WHICH THE CRASH SITE WAS LOCATED WAS APPROXIMATELY 150-200 FEET IN DIAMETER AND NEARLY LEVEL WITH AN APPROXIMATE -4 DEGREE DOWN SLOPE TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST.  THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE PLATEAU SLOPED ABRUPTLY DOWN TO SEA LEVEL.  SITUATED IN THE APPROXIMATE CENTER OF THE CLEARED PLATEAU WAS A HEXAGONAL WOOD FRAME STRUCTURE, WHICH WAS REPORTED BY ACQUAINTANCES OF THE PILOT TO BE A RECREATIONAL FACILITY/HOUSE HE HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTING AT THE SITE. TWO DEAD SNAGS (TREE TRUNKS) WERE NOTED SOUTH-SOUTHWEST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE AT THE EDGE OF THE PLATEAU AND A MODERATELY TALL CONIFER TREE WAS NOTED AT THE WESTERN BOUNDARY OF THE PLATEAU.  NO IMPACT MARKS WERE OBSERVED ON ANY OF THESE THREE TREES AND THERE WERE NO DISCERNIBLE GROUND SCARS THAT COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCIDENT.  THE MAJORITY OF WRECKAGE WAS DISTRIBUTED IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE PLATEAU BETWEEN THE STRUCTURE AND THE PLATEAU'S NORTHERN BOUNDARY (REFER TO DIAGRAM I AND DIGITAL IMAGE 1).

A POST-CRASH FIRE CONSUMED MUCH OF THE HELICOPTER AND DESTROYED THE WOOD FRAME STRUCTURE; AND PRECLUDED ANY SPECIFIC DETERMINATION OF PRE-IMPACT CONTACT BETWEEN THE HELICOPTER AND THE STRUCTURE.  THE LARGEST PIECE OF WRECKAGE CONSISTING OF THE ENGINE/FIREWALL, TRANSMISSION, PYLON AND THE INBOARD TWO-THIRDS OF ONE ROTOR BLADE WAS OBSERVED LYING ON THE GROUND WITH THE HELICOPTER'S VERTICAL AXIS PARALLEL TO THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND (90 DEGREES NOSE DOWN).  THE ENTIRE FORWARD CABIN AREA (FORWARD OF THE FIREWALL) WAS ABSENT (REFER TO DIGITAL IMAGE 2).

THE NEXT LARGEST PIECES OF WRECKAGE WERE OBSERVED DISTRIBUTED FROM THIS MAIN PIECE IN AN ARC FROM THE NORTH TO THE WEST AND INCLUDED THE TAILBOOM WITH ITS VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL STABILIZERS AND THE TAIL ROTOR ASSEMBLY (REFER TO DIGITAL IMAGE 3), ONE LONG SECTION OF SKID, AND BOTH THE MAIN AND AUXILIARY FUEL TANKS.  THE PILOT WAS OBSERVED CLEAR OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE AND ALONGSIDE THE WOOD FRAME STRUCTURE APPROXIMATELY 22 FEET SOUTHWEST OF THE ENGINE.  BOTH THE 19.2 GALLON (USABLE) MAIN FUEL TANK AND THE 10.5 GALLON (USABLE) AUXILIARY FUEL TANK WERE OBSERVED LYING ON THE GROUND AND DISPLAYED FIRE DAMAGE.  A GENERAL BURN PATTERN IN THE GRASS SURROUNDING EACH TANK WAS NOTED.

A LARGE NUMBER OF FRAGMENTS OF BROKEN PLEXIGLAS, COCKPIT FLIGHT CONTROLS AND ASSOCIATED LINKAGES, AND COCKPIT STRUCTURE WERE OBSERVED DISTRIBUTED IN AN ARC FROM THE NORTHEAST TO THE EAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  THE ENTIRE OPPOSING ROTOR BLADE WAS OBSERVED LYING IN SHORT GRASS APPROXIMATELY 75 FEET EAST-NORTHEAST OF THE ENGINE (REFER TO DIGITAL IMAGE 4).  THE REMAINING ONE-THIRD (OUTBOARD THREE FOOT PORTION) OF THE ROTOR BLADE RETAINED AT THE PYLON WAS DESTROYED BY FIRE, AND THE OUTBOARD ONE FOOT BLADE TIP SECTION WAS NOT LOCATED.  THE LEADING EDGE CAP FROM THIS THREE FOOT SECTION OF BLADE (EXCLUSIVE OF THE MISSING TIP) WAS FOUND WITHIN A BURNED WOODPILE APPROXIMATELY 10-15 FEET WEST OF THE ENGINE (REFER TO DIGITAL IMAGE 2).  ADDITIONALLY, A SECTION OF SKID TOE WAS LOCATED 125 FEET SOUTH-SOUTHWEST OF THE ENGINE NEAR THE BASE OF TWO DEAD SNAGS AT THE EDGE OF THE PLATEAU.  THE RUDDER PEDALS AND INSTRUMENT PANEL/CONSOLE WERE NOT LOCATED.

INSPECTION OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES REVEALED THAT THE INTACT BLADE ALONG WITH ITS SPINDLE HAD SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN ROTOR HUB AT THE JUNCTION POINT OF THE TOP AND BOTTOM MATING SURFACES BETWEEN THE ROTOR FORK AND THE SPINDLE.  THE ATTACH BOLT WAS SEPARATED WITH THE CENTER SECTION OF THE BOLT SHAFT REMAINING WITHIN THE SPINDLE AND THE TWO END BOLT SECTIONS WERE OBSERVED LYING ON THE GROUND NOT FAR FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  ALL FOUR BOLT FRACTURE SURFACES DISPLAYED HORIZONTAL SHEAR SIGNATURES (REFER TO DIGITAL IMAGES 5, 6, 7 AND 8).  THE ENTIRE LEADING EDGE OF THE BLADE DISPLAYED VIRTUALLY NO IMPACT MARKS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 1) A SMALL AREA MIDSPAN SHOWING ABRASION MARKS AT THE LEADING EDGE AND PROGRESSING ACROSS THE SURFACE OF THE BLADE AND 2) THE LAST (OUTBOARD) ONE FOOT SECTION WHERE NOTICEABLE SCRATCH MARKS NEARLY PERPENDICULAR TO THE BLADE'S CHORDLINE AND ORIGINATING AT THE LEADING EDGE WERE NOTED.  THE MIDSPAN ABRASIONS WERE GRAY IN COLOR AND CLOSELY MATCHED THE COLOR OF A FRAGMENTED CONCRETE BIRDBATH LYING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE BLADE.

THE OPPOSING BLADE'S INBOARD TWO-THIRDS SECTION REMAINED ATTACHED AT THE HUB WITH THE ATTACH BOLT RETAINING THE SPINDLE TO THE HUB.  THE PITCH LINK WAS DISCONNECTED AND THE BLADE HAD ROTATED APPROXIMATELY 180 DEGREES OUT OF ITS NORMAL POSITION.  THIS SECTION OF BLADE DISPLAYED A NOTICEABLE UPWARD (CONCAVE FROM THE UPPER SIDE OF THE BLADE) PERMANENT DEFORMATION EXCEPT AT THE OUTBOARD SEPARATION POINT WHERE A DISTINCT DOWNWARD BENDING WAS OBSERVED (REFER TO DIGITAL IMAGE 9).  THE OUTBOARD THREE FOOT SECTION DISPLAYED UPWARD BENDING MOST NOTICEABLY AT THE OUTBOARD END (ADJOINING THE MISSING ONE FOOT TIP SECTION).  THE INBOARD SEPARATION MATCHED THE OUTBOARD SURFACE OF THE INNER BLADE SECTION AND ALSO DISPLAYED AN ABRUPT DOWNWARD BEND AT THE SEPARATION AREA (REFER TO GRAPHIC IMAGE 10).

THE MAIN ROTOR HUB WAS EXAMINED AND THE ELASTOMERIC TEETER STOP ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETAINED BLADE DISPLAYED LATERAL COMPRESSIVE CRUSHING DAMAGE (REFER TO DIGITAL IMAGE 11).  THE OPPOSING ELASTOMERIC TEETER STOP (RELEASED BLADE) WAS ABSENT AND THE TEETER STOP BRACKET WAS BROKEN AND DEFORMED (REFER TO DIGITAL IMAGE 12).  THE UPPER PORTION OF THE MAIN ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT OUTSIDE DIAMETER ABEAM THE SPINDLE FOR THE RELEASED BLADE DISPLAYED A HORIZONTAL DENT OR IMPRESSION CHARACTERISTIC OF CONTACT WITH THE OUTER-UPPER EDGE OF THE HUB ASSEMBLY (REFER TO DIGITAL IMAGE 13).

THE TAILBOOM SEPARATED JUST AFT OF THE FUSELAGE ATTACH POINT.  THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER DISPLAYED LITTLE DAMAGE.  THE LOWER VERTICAL FIN DISPLAYED SOME BENDING DEFORMATION AND THE TAIL STINGER WAS BENT UPWARD.  THE UPPER VERTICAL FIN DISPLAYED LIGHT LEADING EDGE DAMAGE AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER AND WAS DEFORMED AFT WITH BUCKLING DEFORMATION ALONG THE TRAILING EDGE ADJACENT TO THE HUB ATTACH POINT (REFER TO DIGITAL IMAGE 14).

POST CRASH EXAMINATION OF THE NON FIRE-CONSUMED REMAINS OF THE FLIGHT CONTROLS AND THE HELICOPTER'S O-360-J2A ENGINE REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF PRE-IMPACT MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION.


MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

NORMAN THIERSCH, M.D., CONDUCTED POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION OF THE PILOT AT THE FACILITIES OF THE SNOHOMISH MEDICAL EXAMINER'S FACILITIES, EVERETT, WASHINGTON, ON JULY 23, 2003, (CASE NUMBER SCME 03SN1292).

THE FAA'S TOXICOLOGY ACCIDENT AND RESEARCH LABORATORY, OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA CONDUCTED TOXICOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF SAMPLES FROM THE PILOT.  ALL FINDINGS WERE NEGATIVE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AN INDETERMINATE QUANTITY OF QUININE DETECTED IN BOTH BLOOD AND LIVER (REFER TO ATTACHED TOX REPORT).


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ON-SITE EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE WAS CONDUCTED ON JULY 22 AND 23, 2003, AFTER WHICH THE WRECKAGE WAS VERBALLY RELEASED TO A FAMILY REPRESENTATIVE.  WRITTEN WRECKAGE RELEASE WAS ACCOMPLISHED ON JULY 29, 2003, AND WAS DOCUMENTED ON NTSB FORM 6120.15 (ATTACHED).  THOSE ITEMS RETAINED (TWO BLADE RETENTION BOLT ENDS AND AN APPROXIMATE 3-FOOT SECTION OF OUTBOARD LEADING EDGE BLADE SECTION) WERE RETURNED TO A FAMILY REPRESENTATIVE ON MARCH 16, 2004, (REFER TO ATTACHMENT FX-I).","THE PILOT LANDED HIS HELICOPTER ON A BLUFF ADJACENT TO A HEXAGONAL WOOD FRAME STRUCTURE, WHICH HE HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTING. ALTHOUGH HE HAD LANDED AT THE SITE ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DONE SO WITH THE STRUCTURE IN PLACE.   HE SUBSEQUENTLY WALKED DOWN AND VISITED A RELATIVE AND THEN WALKED  BACK TO THE HELICOPTER AFTER ADVISING THE RELATIVE HE WOULD RETURN LATER.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER THE RELATIVE HEARD A ""BOOM"" AND THEN NOTED A FIRE ON THE BLUFF.  THERE WERE NO EYEWITNESSES TO THE ACCIDENT AND IT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED WHETHER THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED PRIOR TO DEPARTURE, DURING DEPARTURE OR DURING A RETURN TO THE LANDING SITE AFTER DEPARTURE.  A POST CRASH FIRE DESTROYED MOST OF THE HELICOPTER AND THE WOOD FRAME STRUCTURE.  NO GROUND IMPACT MARKS WERE NOTED AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY PART OF THE HELICOPTER STRUCK ANY OF THE SEVERAL TREES/DEAD SNAGS AT THE PERIMETER OF THE BLUFF.  THE PILOT HAD AN ESTIMATED 5,192 HOURS OF TOTAL FLIGHT EXPERIENCE OF WHICH 772 WERE IN ROTORCRAFT AND 374 HOURS WERE IN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER.  WINDS WERE LIGHT AND VARIABLE AND VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS EXISTED AT THE TIME.  POST CRASH EXAMINATION OF THE NON FIRE-CONSUMED REMAINS OF THE FLIGHT CONTROLS AND THE HELICOPTER'S O-360-J2A ENGINE REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF PRE-IMPACT MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION.  ALL MAJOR COMPONENTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ANTI-TORQUE PEDALS AND INSTRUMENT CONSOLE WERE IDENTIFIED/LOCATED AT THE ACCIDENT SITE.  ONE MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS RELEASED WHEN THE BLADE RETENTION BOLT SEPARATED AT BOTH ENDS IN SHEAR OVERLOAD, AND THE BLADE DISPLAYED MINIMAL LEADING EDGE DAMAGE.  THE OPPOSING BLADE'S OUTBOARD 4 FOOT SECTION SEPARATED FROM THE INBOARD SECTION AND THE INBOARD SECTION REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE ROTOR MAST.  THE INBOARD BLADE SECTION DISPLAYED UPWARD BENDING AND THE SEPARATION POINT DISPLAYED ABRUPT DOWNWARD BENDING.  THREE FEET OF THE  OUTBOARD 4 FOOT SECTION WAS DESTROYED BY FIRE BUT THE LEADING EDGE STRIP WAS FOUND.  THE OUTBOARD ONE FOOT TIP WAS NOT RECOVERED.  THERE WAS A LIGHT IMPACT IMPRESSION AT THE TOP OF THE MAIN ROTOR SHAFT (OUTSIDE DIAMETER) INDICATING MAST BUMPING AND THE ELASTOMERIC TEETER STOP WAS ABSENT.  THE OPPOSING STOP WAS CRUSHED.  AN INDETERMINATE QUANTITY OF QUININE WAS DETECTED IN THE PILOT'S BLOOD AND LIVER DURING TOXICOLOGICAL EVALUATION.",A LOSS OF CONTROL FOR UNKNOWN REASONS.

ON JULY 26, 2003, AT 1028 MOUNTAIN STANDARD TIME, A BELL 206L-3, N6184D (FIRE CALL SIGN HELICOPTER 356), CRASHED NEAR WHITERIVER, ARIZONA.  THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS (BIA), FORT APACHE INDIAN RESERVATION, OPERATED THE HELICOPTER UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 14 CFR PART 91.  THE HELICOPTER WAS DESTROYED.  THE COMMERCIAL PILOT AND ONE PASSENGER WERE FATALLY INJURED; TWO PASSENGERS SUSTAINED SERIOUS INJURIES.  ONE PERSON ON THE GROUND WAS NOT INJURED.  THE PUBLIC-USE FLIGHT DEPARTED THE WHITERIVER AIRPORT (E24), AT 1000, EN ROUTE TO THE WILDERNESS FIRE IN THE VICINITY OF ASPEN RIDGE, 12 STATUTE MILES FROM E24.  DAY VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED, AND A BIA COMPANY FLIGHT PLAN HAD BEEN FILED.  

THE FIRST FLIGHT OF THE DAY TO DO A RECONNAISSANCE WORK ON THE KINISHBA FIRE WAS PERFORMED BETWEEN 0858 AND 0932.  THE HELICOPTER RETURNED TO WHITERIVER, AND THE SECOND FLIGHT, THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT, DEPARTED AT 1000.

ACCORDING TO A NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE ZONE FORECAST FOR THE NORTHERN ARIZONA AREA, THE WEATHER WAS FORECASTED TO BE PARTLY CLOUDY IN THE MORNING THEN BECOMING MOSTLY CLOUDY, WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS; LIGHT WINDS, WITH A 50 PERCENT CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION.  THE TEMPERATURE WAS FORECASTED TO BE FROM 73 DEGREES TO 80 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

WEATHER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE FIRE LOOKOUT REPORTED THE WEATHER AS 73 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT WITH SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS FROM 2-4 MILES PER HOUR.  THE DENSITY ALTITUDE WAS CALCULATED TO BE 11,968 FEET.

THE PURPOSE OF THE FLIGHT WAS TO INSERT A 3-PERSON HELICOPTER INITIAL ATTACK (HELITACK) CREW TO CONDUCT AN INITIAL ATTACK FOR A WILDLAND FIRE ALONG ASPEN RIDGE. 

WITNESS STATEMENTS

A RECONNAISSANCE FLIGHT WAS THE FIRST FLIGHT OF THE DAY FOR THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER.  PASSENGERS ON BOARD THE FLIGHT STATED THAT THE FIRST FLIGHT WAS AT 0830.  WHEN THE PILOT FIRST STARTED THE HELICOPTER, THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES MADE A ""FEW REVOLUTIONS,"" THEN STOPPED.  AFTER ABOUT 2-3 MINUTES, THE PILOT WAS ABLE TO START THE HELICOPTER.  ONE PASSENGER REPORTED THAT DURING THE FLIGHT, THE PILOT CONDUCTED TURNS, AS WELL AS LOW-LEVEL FLIGHT OBSERVATIONS WITH NO DISCREPANCIES NOTED.  THE PASSENGER ALSO REPORTED THAT THE FLIGHT WAS ABOUT AN HOUR IN LENGTH.

ANOTHER PILOT DEPARTING E24 RECALLED HEARING ""PULL UP"" THREE TIMES OVER THE RADIO, FOLLOWED MOMENTS LATER BY ""DISPATCH, DISPATCH, DISPATCH, 356 IS DOWN, 356 IS DOWN.""  HE IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO E24, HAD THE LONG LINE AND BAMBI BUCKET REMOVED, AND BOARDED A HELICOPTER MANAGER ALONG WITH A PARAMEDIC AND DEPARTED FOR THE ACCIDENT SITE.  THE PILOT RECALLED OBSERVING THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER ABORT ONE START EARLIER THAT MORNING.  HE FURTHER STATED THAT ON THE SECOND START THE HELICOPTER ""JUST SEEMED KIND OF SLOW OR SLUGGISH TO SPOOL UP AND COMPLETE ITS START.""  HE ATTRIBUTED THIS TO THE ""WARM START"" FOLLOWED BY A ""SLIGHTLY WEAKER BATTERY.""

HELICOPTER MANAGER (HEMG - ON BOARD ACCIDENT HELICOPTER - SURVIVOR)

THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD INVESTIGATOR-IN-CHARGE (IIC) INTERVIEWED THE HELICOPTER MANAGER.  HE STATED THAT THE FIRST FLIGHT OF THE DAY WAS A RECONNAISSANCE OF THE KINISHBA FIRE.  THE FIRST STARTUP OF THE DAY WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.  THE PILOT WAS ABLE TO START THE HELICOPTER ON THE SECOND TRY AND NO MECHANICAL DIFFICULTIES WERE ENCOUNTERED.  THE FIRST FLIGHT OF THE DAY WAS UNEVENTFUL. 

THE HELICOPTER MANAGER STATED THAT HE RECEIVED A CALL FROM DISPATCH ABOUT A FIRE ""GOING UP ASPEN RIDGE.""  HE STATED THAT HE CONDUCTED A SAFETY BRIEFING WITH THE HELITACK CREW PRIOR TO GETTING IN THE HELICOPTER.  HE WAS SEATED IN THE FRONT LEFT SEAT, AND THE THREE HELITACK CREWMEMBERS WERE SEATED IN THE PASSENGER CABIN; TWO FACING FORWARD, AND A THIRD SEATED BEHIND THE PILOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE IN THE AFT-FACING SEAT.  THE 3-PERSON HELITACK CREW CONSISTED OF A SQUAD BOSS, AND TWO HELITACK CREWMEMBERS.  HE ALSO INDICATED THAT THE PILOT WAS FLYING WITH THE PILOT'S DOOR OFF; HOWEVER, THE OTHER DOORS REMAINED ON. 

ONCE AIRBORNE THEY SAW SMOKE FROM THE WILDLAND FIRE AND FLEW TOWARDS IT.  HE STATED THAT THE PILOT MADE TWO PASSES OVER THE FIRE.  DURING THE TWO PASSES THEY NOTICED A MEADOW, AND ANOTHER CLEARING CLOSER TO THE FIRE THAT THEY COULD UTILIZE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF DROPS.  THE PLAN WAS TO OFF-LOAD TWO HELITACK CREWMEMBERS AT THE MEADOW, TAKE THE THIRD CREWMAN TO THE LANDING ZONE (LZ) WITH THE TOOLS, AND THEN COME BACK TO THE MEADOW FOR THE OTHERS, ULTIMATELY DROPPING THEM OFF AT THE LZ.

THE WITNESS STATED THAT WHEN THEY LANDED AT THE LZ WITH THE ONE HELITACK CREWMAN AND THE TOOLS, HE HEARD A ""KNOCKING"" NOISE.  THE PILOT MENTIONED MAST BUMPING, BUT SAID EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.  WHEN THEY TOOK OFF FROM THE LZ, THE WITNESS NOTICED THAT THE TORQUE GAUGE WAS AT 100 PERCENT AND THE HELICOPTER WAS ""HARD TO GET OFF THE GROUND.""  THEY LANDED AT THE MEADOW WITH NO PROBLEMS.

NO PROBLEMS WERE NOTED WITH THE TAKEOFF FROM THE MEADOW.  HOWEVER, THE WITNESS STATED THAT THE CLIMB OUT WAS SLOW.  HE DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE TORQUE GAUGE ON THIS TAKEOFF BECAUSE HE HAD RADIOED DISPATCH TO CHECK IN.

ON THE FLIGHT TO THE LZ, THE WITNESS STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS FLYING SLOWLY, ABOUT 20 FEET ABOVE THE TREE LINE.  FOR UNKNOWN REASONS, THE PILOT FLEW PAST THE LZ, AND CONTINUED UP THE DRAINAGE AREA. 

THE WITNESS NOTED THAT THE TORQUE GAUGE READ 100 PERCENT.  SIMULTANEOUSLY THE TORQUE READING WENT FROM 100 TO 105 THEN TO 110 PERCENT AS THE PILOT STARTED TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN.  HE ASKED THE PILOT IF THE TAIL ROTOR WAS GOING TO STALL, BUT RECEIVED NO RESPONSE.  AT THAT POINT, HE NOTED THE FUEL GAUGE READ 200 POUNDS AND THE AIRSPEED GAUGE READ ZERO. 

THE WITNESS STATED THAT AS THE PILOT WAS BEGINNING THE RIGHT TURN HE COULD SEE HIM ""FIGHTING WITH THE [FLIGHT] CONTROLS.""  HE REPORTED THAT THE PILOT WAS MOVING THE COLLECTIVE, CYCLIC, AND ""HIS FEET.""  THE WITNESS RADIOED DISPATCH, SAYING ""DISPATCH"" SIX TIMES BEFORE THE HELICOPTER STARTED TO SPIN.  HE REMEMBERS THE HELICOPTER SPINNING TWO TIMES TO THE RIGHT, AND THE NEXT THING HE REMEMBERED WAS TRYING TO BREATHE. 

IN A SUBSEQUENT INTERVIEW, THE WITNESS ALSO REPORTED THAT HE BELIEVED THAT WHILE THEY FLEW FROM THE MEADOW TO THE LZ THEY WOULD LAND ""IN THE DIRECTION THE WIND WAS COMING FROM.""  HOWEVER, THE HELICOPTER CONTINUED IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION UP THE DRAINAGE AREA WHEN HE OBSERVED THE TORQUE GAUGE FLUCTUATION.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT THE FORWARD AIRSPEED WAS GOING TO ZERO AS THE PILOT TURNED TO THE RIGHT TO RETURN TO THE LZ.  HE STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER STARTED TO SHAKE, THE TORQUE GAUGE WAS AT 100 PERCENT AND REMAINED AT 100 PERCENT AS THE HELICOPTER CONTINUED TO CLIMB.  AT THAT POINT HE ASKED THE PILOT ""ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A TAIL ROTOR STALL SHORTLY?""  HE INDICATED THAT THE SPIN WAS A ""FLAT SPIN.""

GROUND WITNESS

THE SAFETY BOARD IIC INTERVIEWED A GROUND WITNESS TO THE ACCIDENT.  THE HELITACK CREWMAN HAD BEEN DROPPED OFF AT THE ROAD LZ, 100 YARDS WEST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE.  HE STATED THAT THERE WERE FIVE PEOPLE IN THE HELICOPTER WHEN THEY DEPARTED E24.  NO PROBLEMS WERE NOTED WITH THE FLIGHT TO ASPEN RIDGE.  THEY LANDED AT A MEADOW, AND TWO OF THE HELITACK CREWMEMBERS EXITED THE HELICOPTER.

THE HELICOPTER THEN FLEW UP THE DRAINAGE AREA TO THE LZ, WHERE THE WITNESS EXITED AND OFF-LOADED FIRE PACKS AND TOOLS.  HE STATED THAT THE INITIAL LANDING WAS ON THE FRONT SIDE OF A SMALL HUMP IN THE ROAD.  PRIOR TO HIS EXITING, THE PILOT MOVED THE HELICOPTER BACK TO A FLATTER AREA.  WHEN THE PILOT REPOSITIONED THE HELICOPTER, THE WITNESS HEARD A KNOCKING NOISE. 

THE WITNESS STATED THAT THE PILOT TOOK OFF AGAIN FOR THE MEADOW.  HE REPORTED THAT WHEN THE HELICOPTER CAME BACK TO THE LZ, IT WAS ABOUT 10-20 FEET ABOVE THE TREE LINE.  HE ESTIMATED THAT THE TREES WERE ABOUT 100-FEET TALL.  HE ALSO STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS FLYING SLOWLY. 

THE WITNESS STATED THAT HE WAS GETTING READY TO MARSHAL THE FLIGHT IN WHEN THE HELICOPTER FLEW PAST HIM, CONTINUING UP THE DRAINAGE AREA.  THE WITNESS REPORTED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHY THEY FLEW PAST HIM.  HE LOOKED AWAY TO DO SOMETHING ELSE, AND HEARD A NOISE.  WHEN HE LOOKED UP HE SAW THE HELICOPTER SPINNING TO THE RIGHT AND THEN LOST SIGHT WITH THE HELICOPTER BUT HEARD WHAT HE BELIEVED WAS THE HELICOPTER HITTING THE TREES. 

THE GROUND WITNESS RAN TO THE ACCIDENT SITE, AND RESCUED THE SURVIVORS.  DURING THE RESCUE HE EXTINGUISHED A POST-FIRE IN THE ENGINE AREA.

IN THE GROUND WITNESS' WRITTEN STATEMENT, HE INDICATED THAT THE LZ CLOSER TO THE FIRE WAS ""PRETTY TIGHT TO LAND IN.""  ON THE INITIAL LANDING THE HELICOPTER SLID ""A LITTLE THEN WE LIFTED UP A LITTLE BACKWARDS, AND THEN WE LANDED KIND [OF] LIKE IN [AN] UPWARD"" ATTITUDE.  THE HEMG INDICATED IT WAS OKAY FOR HIM TO EXIT THE HELICOPTER.  HOWEVER, BEFORE HE EXITED HE HEARD A NOISE, LIKE A ""LOUD THUMPING NOISE.""  HE OFF-LOADED THE TOOLS, DAYPACKS, AND POWER SAW.  THE HELICOPTER LIFTED OFF TO PICK UP THE OTHER TWO HELITACK CREW.  HE SAW THE HELICOPTER APPROACH TO LAND AT THE LZ, BUT IT FLEW PAST HIM ANOTHER 70 TO 150 YARDS.  HE THEN HEARD THE HELICOPTER ""SOUND LIKE IT WAS LOSING POWER,"" SO HE LOOKED IN THE HELICOPTER'S DIRECTION AND SAW IT ""GOING IN CIRCLES [AT] TREE TOP LEVEL.""  HE THEN HEARD IT HIT TREES AND WENT TO RENDER ASSISTANCE.

RESCUE CREW

A FLIGHT AND PARAMEDIC CREW WERE DISPATCHED TO THE ACCIDENT SITE AND RESPONDED WITH IN 5 MINUTES.  ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, THEY CIRCLED THE AREA FOR AN ADDITIONAL 20 MINUTES LOOKING FOR A LANDING SITE.  HE IDENTIFIED ONE SPOT, THE LZ WHERE THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER HAD LANDED ONCE AND WAS ATTEMPTING TO LAND AT AGAIN WHEN THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED, THAT HE DEEMED ""IFFY.""  THE PILOT STATED THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES LANDING THERE; IT HAD A LITTLE SLOPE TO IT - A CLEAR AREA, BUT WITH A ""BIG MOUND OF DIRT"" ON THE NORTH SIDE.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS LOCATED ON A LOGGING ROAD IN A HEAVILY FORESTED AREA INDICATIVE OF NORTHERN ARIZONA TERRAIN.  THE PRIMARY WRECKAGE WAS AT 33 DEGREES 53.148 MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE AND 109 DEGREES 40.486 MINUTES WEST LONGITUDE, WITH AN ELEVATION OF 9,232-FEET MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL).  THE DENSITY ALTITUDE WAS CALCULATED TO BE 11,968 FEET.  THE HELICOPTER WAS GIVEN THE CALL SIGN OF H356 BY WHITERIVER DISPATCH. 

THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST AT THE BASE OF A DOUGLAS FIR TREE LYING ON ITS LEFT SIDE.  THE TREE WAS ABOUT 100-FEET TALL.  A 22-FOOT SECTION (TOP OF THE TREE) CAME TO REST IN FRONT AND NEXT TO THE NOSE OF THE HELICOPTER.  A 4-FOOT SECTION OF CUT TREE CAME TO REST WITH THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER.

THE NOSE OF THE HELICOPTER WAS ON A MAGNETIC HEADING OF 180 DEGREES.  THE DEBRIS PATH WAS LOCATED TO THE SOUTH OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, WITH THE FARTHEST PIECE FOUND ABOUT 50 YARDS FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  THE MAIN WRECKAGE CONSISTED OF THE FUSELAGE, TAIL BOOM, DOORS, TRANSMISSION, AND BOTH MAIN ROTOR BLADES.

THE HELICOPTER WAS CONFIGURED FOR THE PILOT TO FLY WITH THE DOOR OFF.  THE OTHER DOORS HAD SEPARATED FROM THE FUSELAGE, BUT WERE FOUND IN THE MAIN WRECKAGE AREA.  THE FUSELAGE AT THE REAR SEAT AREA WAS BENT NEARLY 90 DEGREES ALONG THE LONGITUDINAL AXIS.

THE UPPER DECK OF THE TRANSMISSION SEPARATED FROM THE HELICOPTER, AND WAS LOCATED ADJACENT TO THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  THE UPPER DECK REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE TRANSMISSION, MAIN ROTOR MAST, MAIN ROTOR HUB, AND ONE MAIN ROTOR BLADE.  THE INBOARD PORTION OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE HAD PUNCTURE HOLES IN THE BLADE AND SHOWED EVIDENCE OF BLUE PAINT TRANSFER ON THE UPPER SIDE.  THE OTHER BLADE SEPARATED APPROXIMATELY 4 FEET FROM THE HUB.  THE BLADE WAS LYING NEXT TO THE MAIN WRECKAGE.

THE TAIL BOOM SEPARATED FROM THE HELICOPTER IN TWO PORTIONS.  THE PORTION THAT HOUSES THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER","DURING A RIGHT TURN TO RETURN TO A MOUNTAIN LANDING SITE, THE HELICOPTER BEGAN TO SPIN AND STRUCK TREES.  THE FLIGHT'S MISSION WAS TO INSERT A HELICOPTER FIRE ATTACK CREW AT THE LOCATION OF A WILDFIRE.  THE LANDING ZONE (LZ) CLOSEST TO THE FIRE WAS IN A SMALL AREA SURROUNDED BY TREES.  THE DENSITY ALTITUDE WAS CALCULATED TO BE 11,968 FEET.  THE PILOT FIRST LANDED AT A MEADOW ABOUT A MILE AWAY AND OFF-LOADED TWO FIRE FIGHTERS, THEN PROCEEDED TO THE LZ, AND DROPPED OFF THE ONE REMAINING FIRE FIGHTER AND TOOLS.  HE RETURNED TO THE MEADOW, WHERE HE PICKED UP THE ADDITIONAL CREWMEMBERS.  THE FLIGHT RETURNED TO THE LANDING SITE, OVERFLEW THE LZ AND CONTINUED UP THE DRAINAGE BEFORE MAKING A RIGHT TURN BACK TOWARDS THE LZ.  ONE WITNESS SEATED IN THE FRONT LEFT SEAT NOTED THAT ON THE FIRST TAKEOFF FROM THE MEADOW THE TORQUE GAUGE WAS AT 100 PERCENT AND THE HELICOPTER WAS ""HARD TO GET OFF THE GROUND"" AND THE CLIMB OUT WAS SLOW AND LABORED.  ON THE RETURN FLIGHT TO THE LZ, THE FIRST FIRE FIGHTER DROPPED AT THE LZ SAW THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS FLYING SLOWLY ABOUT 20 FEET ABOVE THE TREE LINE.  HE BELIEVED THEY WOULD LAND WITH THE WIND; HOWEVER, THE PILOT FLEW THE HELICOPTER PAST THE LZ AND CONTINUED UP THE DRAINAGE.  A SURVIVING WITNESS IN THE LEFT FRONT SEAT NOTED THAT THE TORQUE GAUGE READ 100 PERCENT.  AS THE PILOT INITIATED THE RIGHT TURN TO RETURN THE LZ, THE TORQUE READING WENT FROM 100 TO 105 AND THEN 110 PERCENT.  HE ASKED THE PILOT IF THE TAIL ROTOR WAS GOING TO STALL, BUT RECEIVED NO RESPONSE.  THE WITNESS NOTED THAT THE AIRSPEED GAUGE READ ZERO.  AT THAT POINT THE PILOT STARTED TO RAPIDLY MOVE THE COLLECTIVE, CYCLIC, AND ""HIS FEET.""  THE HELICOPTER THEN SPUN TWO TIMES TO THE RIGHT.  BOTH A GROUND WITNESS AND A RESCUE FLIGHT CREW NOTED THAT THE LZ HAD A SLOPE TO IT AND WAS LOCATED IN VERY TIGHT AREA, WITH REPORTED WINDS SOUTHWESTERLY BETWEEN 2-4 KNOTS.  DURING THE ON-SCENE INVESTIGATION, INVESTIGATORS NOTED THAT THE COMPRESSOR BLADES IN THE ENGINE WERE FOLDED OPPOSITE THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION AND THAT TREE FIBERS HAD BEEN INGESTED BY THE COMPRESSOR IMPELLOR, A CONDITION INDICATIVE AN OPERATIONAL ENGINE AT HIGH POWER AT THE TIME OF IMPACT.  THE ENGINE TEARDOWN REVEALED THAT ADDITIONAL TREE FIBERS WERE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE GAS PATH FROM THE COMPRESSOR SECTION THROUGH TO THE COMBUSTION AND EXHAUST SECTIONS.  THERE WERE NO OTHER DISCREPANCIES NOTED WITH THE AIRFRAME OR ENGINE THAT WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED NORMAL OPERATION.","THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM TRANSLATIONAL LIFT AIRSPEED WHILE MANEUVERING IN HIGH DENSITY ALTITUDE CONDITIONS AT NEAR MAXIMUM REQUIRED TORQUE AND ABOVE THE IN GROUND EFFECT HOVER ALTITUDE, THAT RESULTED IN A LOSS OF TAIL ROTOR EFFECTIVENESS AND A LOSS OF CONTROL.  THE PILOT'S INADEQUATE IN FLIGHT PLANNING IN HIS FAILURE TO NOTE AND ACCOUNT FOR THE POWER REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT TAKEOFFS AND THE SLOW MANEUVERING FLIGHT AT THE ACCIDENT SITE WERE ALSO CAUSAL."

ON APRIL 20, 2004, AT 2343 CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME, A BELL 206L-1, N137AE, OPERATED BY AIR EVAC LIFE TEAM AS AIR EVAC 17, COLLIDED WITH THE TERRAIN DURING A MEDIVAC FLIGHT.  THE PATIENT WAS FATALLY INJURED.  THE PILOT, PARAMEDIC, AND NURSE, WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED.  THE HELICOPTER WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED.  THE 14 CFR PART 135 FLIGHT WAS OPERATING IN VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND WAS RECEIVING COMPANY FLIGHT FOLLOWING AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.  THE HELICOPTER LAST DEPARTED THE ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL HELIPORT (II47), IN HUNTINGBURG, INDIANA, WITH AN INTENDED DESTINATION OF DEACONESS HOSPITAL (16IN) IN EVANSVILLE, INDIANA.

AIR EVAC 17 WAS BASED AT THE DAVIES COUNTY AIRPORT (DCY), WASHINGTON, INDIANA.  AT 2151, THE CREW WAS NOTIFIED OF A PATIENT WHO NEEDED TO BE TRANSPORTED FROM II47 TO16IN.  AIR EVAC 17 DEPARTED DCY ABOUT 2204 EN ROUTE TO II47.  AIR EVAC 17 LANDED IN II47 AROUND 2223 AND DEPARTED AROUND 2325 EN ROUTE TO 16IN WITH THE PATIENT ON BOARD.

THE LAST RADIO CONTACT THAT AIR EVAC DISPATCH HAD WITH THE FLIGHT WAS AT 2327 WHEN AIR EVAC 17 REPORTED THEY HAD DEPARTED II47 WITH 4 PEOPLE AND 450 POUNDS OF FUEL ON BOARD.  

THE DESTINATION HELIPAD, 16IN, IS LOCATED WITHIN THE CLASS C AIRSPACE SURROUNDING THE EVANSVILLE REGIONAL AIRPORT (EVV), EVANSVILLE, INDIANA.  THE HOURS OF OPERATION OF THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER AT EVV WERE BETWEEN 0600 AND 2300.  THE AUDIO RECORDING EQUIPMENT WAS INADVERTENTLY LEFT ON AFTER THE TOWER CLOSED.  A RECORDING OF THE APPROACH FREQUENCY COMMUNICATIONS REVEALED THE PILOT OF N137AE MADE 12 RADIO TRANSMISSIONS DURING THE TIME PERIOD 2328 - 2339.  THE FIRST FOUR TRANSMISSIONS WERE ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT THE APPROACH CONTROL.  THE FIFTH TRANSMISSION WAS A PARTIAL TRANSMISSION.  THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY SIX MORE TRANSMISSIONS ATTEMPTING TO CONTACT APPROACH.   THE LAST TRANSMISSION WAS PARTIALLY UNINTELLIGIBLE.  

FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT, THE FLIGHT CREW PARAMEDIC USED A CELLULAR PHONE AND CALLED DISPATCH TO INFORM THEM THAT THEY HAD CRASHED.  A RECORDING OF THE CALL WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE NTSB.  THE BEGINNING OF THE RECORDING IS TIME STAMPED 2344.  THE PARAMEDIC STATED HE DID NOT KNOW THEIR LOCATION AND THE LAST LOCATION HE WAS AWARE OF WAS BEING 8 MINUTES FROM THEIR DESTINATION.  HE STATED THEY WERE IN A FIELD AND HE COULD SEE A FLASHING WHITE LIGHT ON A TOWER THAT WAS A COUPLE MILES AWAY.  

DURING THE CELLULAR CALL, THE PARAMEDIC STATED HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, BUT THE HELICOPTER WAS ON ITS SIDE.  HE LATER STATED THEY JUST HIT THE GROUND.  THE PARAMEDIC INFORMED THE DISPATCHER THAT THE PILOT WAS TRAPPED IN THE WRECKAGE, THE NURSE WAS OUT OF THE WRECKAGE BY THE TAIL OF THE HELICOPTER, THE PATIENT WAS BY THE NOSE OF THE HELICOPTER AND THAT THEY WERE ALL INJURED.  DESPITE HIS INJURIES WHICH INCLUDED A BROKEN JAW, THE PARAMEDIC CONTINUED TALKING WITH DISPATCH, THE PILOT, AND THE NURSE.   THE PARAMEDIC ASKED THE PILOT WHAT HAPPENED AND THE PILOT RESPONDED THAT THEY LOST ALTITUDE.  

DURING THE TIME THAT THE PARAMEDIC WAS ON THE CELL PHONE WITH THE DISPATCHER, OTHER AIR EVAC EMPLOYEES WERE MAKING TELEPHONE CALLS GETTING HELICOPTERS AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES OUT TO SEARCH FOR N137AE.  AT 0055, THE PARAMEDIC INFORMED THE DISPATCHER THAT HE COULD SEE AN AIRCRAFT LIGHT THAT WAS HEADING TOWARD HIM.  AT 0112, THE PARAMEDIC STATED THAT HE WAS ABLE TO SEE FLASHING LIGHTS ON AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE IN THE DISTANCE.  THE PARAMEDIC REMOVED A BLUE PEN LIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER OF THE NURSE AND USED THE LIGHT TO SIGNAL THE HELICOPTERS THAT WERE FLYING OVERHEAD SEARCHING.  AT 0117, THEY WERE LOCATED BY ANOTHER AIR EVAC HELICOPTER.  

ONE WITNESS, WHO WAS AT HIS RESIDENCE LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 300 YARDS NORTH OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, REPORTED THAT AROUND 2330 HE HEARD A HELICOPTER FLY OVERHEAD.  HE REPORTED THE HELICOPTER SOUNDED VERY LOUD AND THAT THE SOUND GRADUALLY FADED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE AS IF IT WAS FLYING AWAY.  HE STATED THAT ABOUT A HALF HOUR LATER HE HEARD ANOTHER HELICOPTER FLYING FROM WEST TO EAST.  HE STATED THIS ONE WAS NOT AS LOUD AS THE FIRST.  HE STATED THAT SHORTLY AFTER HEARING THE SECOND HELICOPTER, HE HEARD OTHERS IN THE AREA AS IF THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING.  HE WAS NOT AWARE OF THE ACCIDENT WHEN HE HEARD THE HELICOPTERS.    

DURING AN INTERVIEW, THE FLIGHT NURSE STATED HE REMEMBERED BEING ABOUT 10 MINUTES AWAY FROM 16IN AND THE NEXT THING HE REMEMBERED IS BEING ON THE GROUND OUTSIDE THE HELICOPTER.  HE STATED HE DOES NOT RECALL ANY PROBLEMS PRIOR TO THE HELICOPTER IMPACTING THE GROUND.  

IN A POST-ACCIDENT INTERVIEW, THE PARAMEDIC STATED THAT HE REMEMBERED PICKING UP THE PATIENT IN HUNTINGBURG AND CARING FOR THE PATIENT DURING THE FLIGHT.  HE STATED THE NEXT THING HE REMEMBERED IS IMPACTING THE GROUND, GETTING OUT OF THE HELICOPTER, AND MAKING THE CALL TO DISPATCH TO GET HELP.  HE STATED THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER THE PILOT INDICATING THAT THERE WERE ANY PROBLEMS PRIOR TO IMPACTING THE GROUND.  HE STATED THAT HE RECALLED IT BEING WINDY AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.   

IN A POST-ACCIDENT INTERVIEW, THE PILOT STATED HE RECALLED PICKING UP THE PATIENT IN HUNTINGBURG AND THE NEXT THING HE REMEMBERED IS THE HELICOPTER TUMBLING ON THE GROUND.  HE STATED HE REMEMBERED BEING TRAPPED INSIDE THE WRECKAGE.  

THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIANS (EMT) WHO TREATED THE PILOT AT THE ACCIDENT SITE REPORTED THAT THE PILOT STATED ""BOY I SCREWED UP.""  AN EMT ASKED HIM WHAT HAPPENED AND THE PILOT REPORTED, ""I STARTED MAKING MY TURN AND WE STARTED TUMBLING.""

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS ON THE PROPERTY OF AN ABANDONED STRIP MINE APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF MILE SOUTHWEST OF THE INTERSECTION OF TURPIN HILL ROAD AND MASSEY ROAD IN BOONVILLE, INDIANA.  THE GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) LOCATION OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE WAS 38 DEGREES 07.771 MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE, 087 DEGREES 19.281 MINUTES WEST LONGITUDE AT AN ELEVATION OF 486 FEET MSL.  THIS LOCATION WAS APPROXIMATELY 2 SM OUTSIDE OF THE CLASS C AIRSPACE AT EVV.

THE WRECKAGE PATH WAS 187 FEET IN LENGTH  ALONG A MAGNETIC HEADING OF 233 DEGREES ON UP-SLOPING TERRAIN.  THE INITIAL GROUND SCARS CONSISTED OF TWO PARALLEL SCARS, WHICH WERE APPROXIMATELY 3 INCHES WIDE AND SPACED ABOUT 7 FEET APART.  IN THE MIDDLE OF THESE SCARS WAS A WIDER GROUND SCAR WHICH CONTAINED THE CUTTER FROM THE WIRE STRIKE PROTECTION SYSTEM AND THE SEARCH LIGHT ASSEMBLY.  THE CUTTER WAS BURIED IN THE GROUND.  THERE WAS A STRONG SMELL OF FUEL PRESENT IN THIS AREA.  JUST BEYOND THIS SCAR WAS A SECTION OF THE FORWARD CROSSTUBE.

APPROXIMATELY 19 FEET TO THE RIGHT OF THE CENTER GROUND SCAR WERE THREE PARALLEL SLASH MARKS IN THE TERRAIN.  THESE MARKS RANGED FROM 14 FEET 7 INCHES TO 3 FEET 3 INCHES IN LENGTH.  THE MAIN WRECKAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 93 FEET FROM THE LAST OF THESE SLASH MARKS.

THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST ON ITS RIGHT SIDE.  THE FUSELAGE WAS FRACTURED JUST FORWARD OF THE TAIL BOOM ATTACH POINT.

THE AREA CONTAINED VERY FEW GROUND STRUCTURES TO PROVIDE REFERENCE LIGHTING.   DURING POST ACCIDENT INTERVIEWS THE PILOT STATED THAT HE REMEMBERED PICKING UP THE PATIENT AND THE NEXT THING HE REMEMBERED IS THE HELICOPTER TUMBLING.  THE FLIGHT NURSE AND PARAMEDIC ON BOARD DID NOT RECALL THERE BEING ANY INDICATION OF A PROBLEM PRIOR TO IMPACT.  THE DESTINATION HOSPITAL IS LOCATED INSIDE THE CLASS C AIRSPACE OF THE EVANSVILLE REGIONAL AIRPORT (EVV).  THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL FACILITY AT EVV CLOSES AT 2300.  BETWEEN 2328 AND 2339, THE PILOT MADE 12 ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH APPROACH CONTROL AS HE APPROACHED THE CLASS C AIRSPACE.  THERE WAS A TIME ZONE CHANGE AT EVV 16 DAYS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.  EXAMINATION OF THE COCKPIT REVEALED THE ALTIMETER WAS SET AT 30.08 INCHES OF MERCURY.  THE CURRENT ALTIMETER SETTING WAS 29.77 INCHES OF MERCURY.  THIS RESULTED IN THE ALTIMETER INDICATING ABOUT 310 FEET HIGHER THEN THE ACTUAL ALTITUDE OF THE HELICOPTER.  THE PILOT WHO FLEW THE HELICOPTER PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT REPORTED THE RADAR ALTIMETER WAS OPERATING ERRATICALLY.  THIS PILOT AND THE MECHANIC WHO MAINTAINED THE HELICOPTER, BOTH STATED THE ACCIDENT PILOT WAS INFORMED OF THE PROBLEM.  BENCH TESTING OF THE RADAR ALTIMETER FAILED TO DUPLICATE THE REPORTED ERRATIC OPERATION.  THE DECISION HEIGHT (DH) BUG ON THE RADAR ALTIMETER WAS FOUND SET TO 60 FEET.  COMPANY POLICY IS THAT THE DH BUG BE SET TO 500 FEET DURING VISUAL NIGHT OPERATIONS.  EXAMINATION OF THE AIRFRAME, ENGINE, AND FLIGHT CONTROLS FAILED TO REVEAL ANY MECHANICAL FAILURE/MALFUNCTION.","THE PILOT'S INADEQUATE PLANNING/DECISION WHICH RESULTED IN HIS FAILURE TO MAINTAIN TERRAIN CLEARANCE.  CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE THE PILOT'S INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT PLANNING, HIS DIVERTED ATTENTION, AND THE DARK NIGHT CONDITIONS."

ON JULY 21, 2004, ABOUT 1540 PACIFIC DAYLIGHT TIME, THE PILOT FLYING A FINKE ROTORWAY EXEC 162F, N103RW, EXPERIENCED AN IN-FLIGHT MALFUNCTION WHILE CRUISING OVER CAMERON PARK, CALIFORNIA.  THE EXPERIMENTAL HELICOPTER ENTERED AN UNCONTROLLED DESCENT AND IMPACTED A PRIVATE RESIDENCE ABOUT 1 MILE SOUTH-SOUTHEAST OF THE CAMERON PARK AIRPORT.  THE HELICOPTER WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED DURING THE IMPACT SEQUENCE, AND IT WAS DESTROYED ALONG WITH A RESIDENCE DURING THE POST IMPACT GROUND FIRE.  THE COMMERCIAL PILOT, WHO WAS ALSO THE HELICOPTER'S OWNER-BUILDER, WAS FATALLY INJURED.  NO ONE ON THE GROUND WAS INJURED.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT THE TIME OF THE TEST FLIGHT, AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED.  THE FLIGHT WAS PERFORMED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 14 CFR PART 91, AND IT ORIGINATED FROM THE AIRPORT ABOUT 1539.

THREE WITNESSES REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD INVESTIGATOR THAT THEY OBSERVED PORTIONS OF THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT.  ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS WHO WAS LOCATED ABOUT 1 MILE NORTH OF THE CRASH SITE, A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT HE HAD OBSERVED THE PILOT PERFORMING MAINTENANCE ON THE HELICOPTER.  ON JULY 21, THE WITNESS OBSERVED THE PILOT TAKEOFF FROM THE CAMERON PARK AIRPORT USING RUNWAY 31.  SECONDS AFTER BECOMING AIRBORNE THE HELICOPTER TURNED LEFT, AND THE PILOT CRUISED IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION ABOUT 200 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL.  THE WITNESS FURTHER STATED THAT AFTER ABOUT 45 SECONDS, HE HEARD AN UNUSUAL SOUND AS THOUGH ROTOR BLADES WERE DEPARTING THE HELICOPTER.  THEN, THE HELICOPTER ROLLED INVERTED AND RAPIDLY DESCENDED.  

THE SECOND WITNESS WAS LOCATED ABOUT 0.3 MILES WEST OF THE CRASH SITE.  THIS WITNESS REPORTED THAT HIS ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TOWARD THE HELICOPTER UPON HEARING AN UNUSUAL ENGINE NOISE.  THE WITNESS REPORTED THAT HE OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER PITCH UPWARD AND APPEARED TO STALL.  THEREAFTER, THE HELICOPTER BANKED LEFT UNTIL ROLLING INVERTED, WHEREUPON PORTIONS OF THE AIRFRAME SEPARATED FROM THE REMAINDER OF THE HELICOPTER, AND THE HELICOPTER DESCENDED STRAIGHT DOWN.  

THE THIRD WITNESS WAS LOCATED ABOUT 0.3 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE CRASH SITE.  WHEN HE OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER IT WAS UPSIDE DOWN.  THE HELICOPTER APPEARED TO BE ROTATING OR SPINNING AROUND AND PIECES WERE FALLING OFF THE HELICOPTER LIKE CONFETTI.  THE WITNESS STATED THAT A PORTION OF THE TAIL APPEARED TO HAVE SEPARATED IN FLIGHT.  NO EVIDENCE OF SMOKE OR FIRE WAS OBSERVED.

PERSONNEL INFORMATION

THE COMMERCIAL PILOT HELD RATINGS FOR AIRPLANE SINGLE ENGINE AND MULTIENGINE LAND, INSTRUMENT AIRPLANE, AND ROTORCRAFT-HELICOPTER.  THE PILOT RECEIVED THE PRIVATE PILOT ROTORCRAFT-HELICOPTER RATING ON JULY 7, 2003.  

ON THE PILOT'S FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) CERTIFICATE APPLICATION FORM HE REPORTED 96 TOTAL HELICOPTER FLYING HOURS.  OF THIS TIME, HIS TOTAL DUAL AND SOLO TIME WAS 30 AND 66 HOURS, RESPECTIVELY.  ACCORDING TO A MEMBER OF THE PILOT'S FAMILY, ALL OF THE PILOT'S HELICOPTER FLIGHT TIME WAS ACQUIRED FLYING THE ACCIDENT MODEL OF HELICOPTER.  

THE PILOT WAS ALSO FAA CERTIFICATED AS A REPAIRMAN, EXPERIMENTAL AIRCRAFT BUILDER.  THE REPAIRMAN CERTIFICATE BORE THE LIMITATION THAT HIS INSPECTION AUTHORITY WAS LIMITED TO HIS (THE ACCIDENT) HELICOPTER.

ACCORDING TO FAA RECORDS, ON DECEMBER 1, 2003, WHEN THE PILOT WAS ISSUED A THIRD-CLASS AVIATION MEDICAL CERTIFICATE, HE REPORTED A TOTAL FLIGHT TIME OF 7,624 HOURS.  THE PILOT ALSO REPORTED HAVING FLOWN 49 HOURS DURING THE PRECEDING 6 MONTHS.

THE PILOT'S PERSONAL FLIGHT RECORD LOGBOOK INDICATES THAT BETWEEN JULY 5 AND 8, 2003, HE RECEIVED ABOUT 5.5 HOURS OF DUAL FLIGHT INSTRUCTION IN THE ROTORWAY 162F HELICOPTER.  THEREAFTER, HE PILOTED THE SAME MODEL OF HELICOPTER AT LEAST 14 ADDITIONAL HOURS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT.  NO FLIGHT TIME WAS FOUND RECORDED IN THE PILOT'S LOGBOOK BETWEEN APRIL 2004 AND THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT.   

HELICOPTER INFORMATION

ON OCTOBER 18, 2001, THE FAA ISSUED A SPECIAL AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATE TO N103RW.  THE HELICOPTER'S CATEGORY DESIGNATION WAS EXPERIMENTAL.  OPERATING LIMITATIONS, ISSUED NOVEMBER 26, 2001, WERE A PART OF THE CERTIFICATE.  ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS REQUIRED THE PILOT TO REMAIN IN FLIGHT TEST, FOLLOWING A MAJOR CHANGE TO THE HELICOPTER, FOR A MINIMUM OF 5 HOURS DURING WHICH FLIGHT WAS ONLY PERMITTED OVER A SPARSELY POPULATED AREA.   

ACCORDING TO RECORDS MAINTAINED BY ROTORWAY INTERNATIONAL, ON MAY 17, 2004, THE PILOT NOTIFIED THE COMPANY VIA TELEPHONE THAT HE HAD EXPERIENCED A SEVERE VIBRATION AND THAT HE HAD INSTALLED AFTER MARKET MAIN ROTOR BLADES (NOT MANUFACTURED BY ROTORWAY) IN HIS HELICOPTER.  THE PILOT STATED THAT THE TAIL BOOM HAD BEEN DAMAGED FROM THE VIBRATION.

AS DIRECTED BY THE SAFETY BOARD INVESTIGATOR, AND UNDER THE ON-SCENE SUPERVISION OF THE FAA, ROTORWAY INTERNATIONAL'S VICE PRESIDENT OF CUSTOMER SERVICE PARTICIPATED IN THE WRECKAGE EXAMINATION.  THE PARTICIPANT REPORTED THAT DURING THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT THE PILOT HAD BEEN FLYING A HELICOPTER THAT DEPARTED FROM ROTORWAY'S DESIGN.  IN PERTINENT PART, THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES HAD NOT BEEN MANUFACTURED BY ROTORWAY.  ROTORWAY PROVIDES METAL MAIN ROTOR BLADES.  THE ACCIDENT BLADES APPEARED COMPOSED OF A FIBER GLASS-LIKE MATERIAL.  

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

ACCORDING TO THE FAA AIRWORTHINESS INSPECTOR WHO RESPONDED TO THE ACCIDENT SITE, PORTIONS OF THE HELICOPTER WERE FOUND SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  SPECIFICALLY, THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE PULLEYS WERE FOUND IN A GOLF COURSE, SEVERAL BLOCKS NORTHWEST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.  THE LAST 3 FEET OF THE TAIL BOOM, INCLUDING THE TAIL ROTOR, WAS FOUND ABOUT 80 FEET SOUTH OF THE CRASH SITE.  A 5-FOOT-LONG SECTION OF THE TAIL BOOM WAS ALSO FOUND ABOUT 270 FEET SOUTHEAST OF THE CRASH SITE.  AN AFT PORTION OF THE TAIL BOOM'S RIGHT SIDE WAS OBSERVED CRUSHED.  THE INDENTATION RESEMBLED THE SHAPE OF A MAIN ROTOR BLADE.
  
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

AN AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED BY THE EL DORADO COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE, PLACERVILLE, CALIFORNIA.  THE FAA'S BIOAERONAUTICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH LABORATORY, OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, PERFORMED TOXICOLOGY TESTS ON SPECIMENS FROM THE PILOT.  RESULTS OF THE TESTS DID NOT REVEAL THE PRESENCE OF CARBON MONOXIDE, CYANIDE, ETHANOL, OR ANY SCREENED DRUGS.

TESTS AND RESEARCH

THE HELICOPTER WAS EXAMINED BY THE FAA AND ROTORWAY PARTICIPANTS.  THE ROTORWAY PARTICIPANT CONFIRMED THAT THE HELICOPTER HAD BEEN PARTIALLY ASSEMBLED USING ROTORWAY SUPPLIED PARTS, IN ADDITION TO COMPONENTS FROM OTHER SOURCES THAT WERE NOT SUPPORTED BY ROTORWAY.   ACCORDING TO THE PARTICIPANT, DURING ASSEMBLY OF THE HELICOPTER, EACH MAIN ROTOR BLADE IS ATTACHED TO A BLADE YOKE WITH A SINGLE RETENTION NUT/BOLT ASSEMBLY.  

THE WRECKAGE EXAMINATION OF ONE OF THE TWO MAIN ROTOR BLADES REVEALED THAT THE NUT USED TO SECURE THE RETENTION BOLT WAS MISSING.  THE RESPECTIVE BOLT WAS EXAMINED.  ITS THREADS DID NOT APPEAR STRIPPED, AND THE BOLT WAS INTACT.  THE PARTICIPANT REPORTED THAT IF THE NUT HAD COME LOOSE IN FLIGHT, THE BLADE WOULD BE FREE TO DIVERGE FROM ITS NORMAL CLOCKWISE PLANE OF ROTATION.  THEREAFTER, THE ROTOR COULD STRIKE THE TAIL BOOM'S RIGHT SIDE CAUSING BOOM SEPARATION.  

DURING THE EXAMINATION, DEFORMATION WAS EVIDENT IN THE THIRD BULKHEAD AREA OF THE TAIL BOOM'S RIGHT SIDE.  THE DEFORMATION WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE TAIL BOOM HAVING BEEN IMPACTED BY A MAIN ROTOR BLADE, ACCORDING TO THE ROTORWAY PARTICIPANT.

ALSO, THE ROTOR BLADE STRAP ASSEMBLIES OF BOTH BLADES SHOWED BENDING SIGNATURES ON THE LOWER/LONGER STRAP.  ACCORDING TO THE ROTORWAY PARTICIPANT, THIS SIGNATURE OCCURS WHEN BLADES CONTACT THE MAIN ROTOR SHAFT (MAST BUMPING).  

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

AN ACQUAINTANCE OF THE ACCIDENT PILOT REPORTED TO THE SAFETY BOARD INVESTIGATOR THAT THE PILOT HAD DETECTED A VIBRATION WHEN PREVIOUSLY OPERATING THE HELICOPTER.  THEREAFTER, MAINTENANCE HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THAT INCLUDED REPLACING THE MAIN AND TAIL ROTOR BLADES.  

ON JULY 27, 2004, ALL RECOVERED WRECKAGE WAS RELEASED TO THE COMPANY THAT RECOVERED THE WRECKAGE.  THE SAFETY BOARD INVESTIGATOR NOTIFIED THE PILOT'S FAMILY VIA TELEPHONE OF THE WRECKAGE RELEASE AND THE STORAGE LOCATION.","WITNESSES SAID THE HELICOPTER WAS IN CRUISE FLIGHT WHEN IT PITCHED UP, ROLLED LEFT TO AN INVERTED ATTITUDE WHILE PORTIONS OF THE AIRFRAME SEPARATED, THEN IT DESCENDED STRAIGHT DOWN TO GROUND IMPACT.  WRECKAGE EXAMINATION FOUND EVIDENCE THAT THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES (MRB) DIVERGED FROM THEIR PLANE OF ROTATION, AND MAST BUMPING OCCURRED.  THEREAFTER, THE BLADES IMPACTED THE TAIL BOOM, WHICH SEPARATED FROM THE HELICOPTER.  THE HELICOPTER BECAME UNCONTROLLABLE, ROLLED INVERTED, AND DESCENDED INTO A RESIDENCE.  PORTIONS OF BOTH THE HELICOPTER AND RESIDENCE WERE CONSUMED IN THE POST IMPACT FIRE.  THE PILOT-BUILDER HELD A REPAIRMAN CERTIFICATE FOR HIS EXPERIMENTAL CATEGORY HELICOPTER.  THE PILOT HAD REPLACED ROTORWAY'S MAIN ROTOR BLADES WITH BLADES MANUFACTURED BY ANOTHER COMPANY.  DURING ASSEMBLY OF THE HELICOPTER, EACH MRB WAS ATTACHED TO ITS RESPECTIVE BLADE YOKE WITH A SINGLE RETENTION NUT/BOLT ASSEMBLY.  THE SUBSEQUENT WRECKAGE EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT THE NUT THAT SECURED ONE OF THE MRBS TO ITS RETENTION BOLT WAS MISSING.  THE RETENTION BOLT WAS EXAMINED, AND ITS THREADS WERE NOT STRIPPED; THE BOLT WAS INTACT.  DURING THE MRB INSTALLATION, THE NUT HAD LIKELY BEEN INADEQUATELY TORQUED, AND THEREAFTER, IT HAD WORKED OFF THE BOLT DURING FLIGHT.  WITH THE BOLT LOOSE, THE MRB WAS FREE TO DIVERGE FROM ITS NORMAL ROTATION PLANE, THUS RENDERING THE HELICOPTER UNCONTROLLABLE.",THE OWNER-BUILDER'S IMPROPER MAIN ROTOR BLADE (MRB) MAINTENANCE/INSTALLATION BY UNDER TORQUING THE BLADE RETAINING NUT.

AT 1322, THE PILOT OF N103MH INFORMED MTC TOWER THAT HE WANTED TO PROCEED DIRECT TO 57D, WHICH IS THE AIRPORT IDENTIFIER FOR THE RAY COMMUNITY AIRPORT, RAY, MICHIGAN.  THE TOWER CONTROLLER APPROVED THIS REQUEST AND INSTRUCTED THE PILOT OF N103MH NOT TO FLY OVER THE BASE.

AT 1323, THE PILOT OF N103MH REPORTED TO THE MTC TOWER ""... I FEEL I'M PICKING UP A VIBRATION.""  THE CONTROLLER ASKED THE PILOT TO REPEAT THE TRANSMISSION AND THE PILOT STATED, ""YES SIR THE HELICOPTER IS STARTING TO SHAKE MORE VIOLENTLY SIR.""

AT 1324, THE MTC CONTROLLER ASKED THE PILOT OF N103MH IF HE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT TO 57D AND THE PILOT RESPONDED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW.  THE CONTROLLER THEN TOLD THE PILOT, ""... IF YOU DECLARE AN EMERGENCY AND NEED TO LAND HERE JUST LET ME KNOW.""

AT 1328, THE PILOT OF N103MH TRANSMITTED, ""TOWER I GONNA COME BACK.""  THE TOWER CONTROLLER RESPONDED, ""... VERIFY YOU ARE DECLARING AN EMERGENCY AND LANDING AT SELFRIDGE.""  THE PILOT RESPONDED, ""YES SIR IT'S GOING TO BE AN EMERGENCY.""  THE CONTROLLER RESPONDED,""... ROGER WIND AT SELFRIDGE ESTIMATED IS THREE TWO ZERO AT EIGHT YOU'RE CLEARED AT THE APPROACH END CORRECTION YOU ARE CLEARED TO LAND IF AT ALL POSSIBLE AT THE DEPARTURE END OF RUNWAY 19 THAT'S AT THE SOUTH END OF THE AIRPORT AT THE INTERSECTION OF 28.""  THE PILOT WAS ASKED TO VERIFY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON BOARD.  

AT 1329, THE CONTROLLER TRANSMITTED, ""THREE MIKE HOTEL IF AT ALL POSSIBLE ON RUNWAY 28 AH JUST AH WEST RUNWAY ONE ONE NINE THAT THE PERFECT SPOT FOR YOU RIGHT THERE.""

ONE OF THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS WHO WAS IN THE TOWER AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT REPORTED N103MH WAS ABOUT 1 MILE SOUTHWEST OF AIRPORT WHEN HE INFORMED THE PILOT THAT HE COULD LAND AT MTC IF HE HAD AN EMERGENCY.  HE STATED N103MH CONTINUED THROUGH THEIR AIRSPACE AND WAS ABOUT 2 MILES NORTHWEST OF THE AIRPORT AT 1,800 FEET ABOVE MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL), [1,220 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND (AGL)], WHEN THE PILOT STATED HE NEEDED TO LAND AT MTC.  THE CONTROLLER STATED THAT HE AND THE OTHER CONTROLLER ON DUTY VIEWED N103MH WITH BINOCULARS.  THE CONTROLLER STATED, ""I NOTICED NOTHING UNUSUAL.""  THE CONTROLLER CONTINUED TO STATE, ""AS HE APPROACHED THE BASE IT LOOKED AS THOUGH HE WASN'T DESCENDING.  AS HE CROSSED THE NORTHERN END OF THE BASE I AGAIN LOOKED AT THE RADAR AND IT INDICATED 1,600 FEET MSL [1,020 FEET AGL].  AS HE APPROACHED JUST SOUTH OF MIDFIELD THE HELO MADE A SHARP CLIMB AND SLIGHT TURN TO THE LEFT.  IT THEN NOSED FORWARD AND DID NOT RECOVER.  I ESTIMATE THE FALL WAS FROM ABOUT 1,400 FEET TO 1,500 FEET MSL [820 FEET TO 920 FEET AGL].""

THE OTHER CONTROLLER ON DUTY IN THE TOWER STATED, ""WE WATCHED HIM FROM THE TOWER GO THROUGH FROM SE TO NW AVOIDING THE BASE PROPER.  DIDN'T SEEM TO BE HAVING PROBLEMS CONTROLLING THE HELICOPTER.  HE GOT 3 NW OF BASE AND TURNED AROUND TO LAND HERE.  STILL DIDN'T APPEAR TO HAVE CONTROL PROBLEMS.  CAME DOWN BETWEEN RUNWAY AND PARALLEL TAXIWAY TO LAND ON SOUTH BRAVO AT INTERSECTION OF 28/10.  GOT OVER DELTA TAXIWAY AND WHAT APPEARED TO BE A 45-60 DEGREE ANGLE DOWN ON WHOLE HELICOPTER.  CRASHED IN THAT ATTITUDE APPROXIMATELY 200 YARDS SOUTH OF DELTA TAXIWAY.""

ANOTHER WITNESS WHO WAS LOCATED ON THE AIRPORT STATED HE FIRST SAW THE HELICOPTER TRAVELING TO THE NORTHWEST AS IT FLEW PAST THE AIRPORT.  HE THEN SAW IT AS IT WAS HEADING BACK TO THE SOUTHEAST.  THIS WITNESS REPORTED THE HELICOPTER WAS FLYING STRAIGHT AND LEVEL, THE ROTOR BLADES WERE TURNING, AND THERE WAS NO SMOKE OR FIRE COMING FROM THE HELICOPTER.  HE STATED HE THEN SAW THE NOSE OF THE HELICOPTER PITCH UP FOLLOWED BY A 70 DEGREE NOSE DOWN ATTITUDE.  HE STATED THE HELICOPTER WAS ABOUT 200 TO 300 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND WHEN IT NOSED DOWN.  THIS WITNESS REPORTED ""BEFORE IMPACT THE PILOT LOOKED TO BE PULLING UP, BUT HE IMPACTED THE GROUND.""

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

AN AUTOPSY ON THE PILOT WAS CONDUCTED BY THE MACOMB COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE ON JULY 29, 2004.

A FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY FATAL ACCIDENT REPORT WAS PREPAR","THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED TERRAIN WHILE ATTEMPTING TO LAND AT A NATIONAL GUARD BASE FOLLOWING A REPORTED VIBRATION IN THE HELICOPTER.  THE PILOT CONTACTED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC) STATING HE WAS 9 MILES SOUTH OF THE BASE AND REQUESTING A CLEARANCE TO TRANSITION THROUGH THEIR AIRSPACE.  THE PILOT WAS CLEARED THROUGH THE AIRSPACE.  WHEN THE HELICOPTER WAS ABOUT 1 MILE SOUTH OF THE BASE, THE PILOT REPORTED TO ATC THAT HE WAS ""... PICKING UP A VIBRATION.""  THE CONTROLLER ASKED THE PILOT TO REPEAT THE TRANSMISSION AND THE PILOT STATED, ""YES SIR THE HELICOPTER IS STARTING TO SHAKE MORE VIOLENTLY SIR.""  THE CONTROLLER INFORMED THE PILOT THAT HE COULD LAND AT THE BASE IF HE DECLARED AN EMERGENCY.  APPROXIMATELY 3 1/2 MINUTES LATER WHEN THE HELICOPTER WAS 2 MILES NORTH OF THE BASE AT 1,800 FEET  MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL), THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE WAS COMING BACK TO LAND.  ATC CLEARED THE PILOT TO LAND REQUESTING IF AT ALL POSSIBLE THAT THE PILOT LAND ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE AIRPORT.  THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS VIEWED THE HELICOPTER THROUGH BINOCULARS.  THEY REPORTED THAT THEY DID NOT NOTICE ANYTHING UNUSUAL WITH THE HELICOPTER AND IT APPEARED NORMAL.  ONE CONTROLLER STATED THE HELICOPTER CROSSED THE NORTHERN END OF THE AIRPORT AT 1,600 FEET MSL [1,020 ABOVE GROUND LEVEL (AGL)].  WITNESSES REPORTED HEARING THE ENGINE AS THE HELICOPTER APPROACHED THE AIRPORT.  THEY STATED THAT ONCE THE HELICOPTER WAS APPROACHING THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE AIRPORT, THE NOSE PITCHED UP THEN DOWN.  WITNESSES DESCRIBED THE DESCENT ANGLE AS BEING BETWEEN 45 AND 70 DEGREES NOSE DOWN.  ONE CONTROLLER ESTIMATED THE DESCENT BEGAN AT AN ALTITUDE OF 1,400 TO 1,500 FEET MSL [820 TO 920 FEET AGL].  THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED THE GRASS LEAVING A WRECKAGE TRAIL APPROXIMATELY 299 FEET LONG.  EXAMINATION OF THE AIRFRAME, FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEMS, AND ENGINE DID NOT REVEAL ANY FAILURE/MALFUNCTION WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN THE ACCIDENT.  A SOUND SPECTRUM EXAMINATION WAS PERFORMED ON A RE-RECORDING OF THE ATC COMMUNICATIONS TO DOCUMENT ENGINE, ROTOR, OR VIBRATION SOUNDS ON THE TAPE.  THIS EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT THE ROTOR SYSTEM BACKGROUND SOUNDS WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE MAIN ROTOR RATING AT ABOUT 101% RPM.  THESE SOUNDS WERE CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE RECORDING INCLUDING THE TRANSMISSIONS AFTER THE PILOT REPORTED A VIBRATION.  IN ADDITION, THE TAPE WAS EXAMINED TO DETERMINE IF ANY AIRFRAME OR ROTOR SYSTEM VIBRATIONS COULD BE IDENTIFIED.  THERE WERE NO ADDITIONAL SOUNDS OR VIBRATIONS IDENTIFIED DURING ANY OF THE TRANSMISSIONS.",A LOSS OF CONTROL IN FLIGHT FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ACCORDING TO THE PILOT'S OPERATING HANDBOOK FOR THE HELICOPTER, ""PUSHING THE CYCLIC FORWARD FOLLOWING A PULL-UP OR RAPID CLIMB, OR EVEN FROM LEVEL FLIGHT, PRODUCES A LOW-G (WEIGHTLESS) FLIGHT CONDITION.  IF THE HELICOPTER IS STILL PITCHING FORWARD WHEN THE PILOT APPLIES AFT CYCLIC TO RELOAD THE ROTOR, THE ROTOR DISK MAY TILT AFT RELATIVE TO THE FUSELAGE BEFORE IT IS RELOADED.  THE MAIN ROTOR TORQUE REACTION WILL THEN COMBINE WITH TAIL ROTOR THRUST TO PRODUCE A POWERFUL RIGHT ROLLING MOMENT ON THE FUSELAGE.  WITH NO LIFT FROM THE ROTOR, THERE IS NO LATERAL CONTROL TO STOP THE RAPID RIGHT ROLE AND MAST BUMPING CAN OCCUR.  SEVERE IN-FLIGHT MAST BUMPING USUALLY RESULTS IN MAIN ROTOR SHAFT SEPARATION AND/OR ROTOR BLADE CONTACT WITH THE FUSELAGE.""

THE MAIN WRECKAGE WAS RELEASED TO THE OWNER ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2004.  THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM WAS RELEASED ON OCTOBER 6, 2006.","THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR AND THE PILOT DEPARTED ON AN INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT, AND ABOUT 45 MINUTES LATER, WITNESSES OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER FLYING ALONG A BEACH BETWEEN 100 AND 200 FEET AGL.

ON NOVEMBER 27, 2004, ABOUT 0935 PACIFIC STANDARD TIME, A ROBINSON R22 BETA HELICOPTER, N4029Q, REGISTERED TO AND OPERATED BY A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL, WAS DESTROYED WHILE MANEUVERING WHEN IT EXPERIENCED AN IN FLIGHT BREAK-UP FOLLOWED BY IMPACT WITH THE TERRAIN DURING AN UNCONTROLLED DESCENT NEAR ARLINGTON, WASHINGTON.  THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR AND THE PILOT-RATED STUDENT SUSTAINED FATAL INJURIES.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AND A FLIGHT PLAN WAS NOT FILED FOR THE 14 CFR PART 91 INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT.  THE LOCAL FLIGHT DEPARTED THE ARLINGTON MUNICIPAL AIRPORT (AWO), ARLINGTON, WASHINGTON, AT APPROXIMATELY 0930. 

IN A STATEMENT SUBMITTED TO THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD INVESTIGATOR-IN-CHARGE (IIC), TWO WITNESSES REPORTED THAT ON THE MORNING OF THE ACCIDENT, AT APPROXIMATELY 0920, THEY OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER BEING STARTED AND LIFTING OFF THE GROUND BEFORE MOVING TO THE RUN-UP AREA, WHICH IS LOCATED AT THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF RUNWAY 34-16.  THE WITNESSES STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER THEN SETTLED ONTO THE GROUND FACING NORTH-NORTHWEST [320 DEGREES], AND REMAINED THERE FOR THE NEXT 2 MINUTES AT TAKEOFF RPM.  THE WITNESSES REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER THEN LIFTED OFF THE GROUND TO ABOUT 3 TO 4 FEET BEFORE TURNING SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT, THEN MAKING A LEFT TURN OF APPROXIMATELY 320 DEGREES BEFORE SLOWLY ACCELERATING AND ALIGNING ITSELF PARALLEL TO THE TAXIWAY.  THE WITNESSES STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER THEN SLOWLY CLIMBED TO 75 TO 100 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL (AGL) BEFORE DEPARTING TO THE NORTH, AND AT ALL TIMES THE HELICOPTER SOUNDED NORMAL AND WAS VERY SMOOTH IN FLIGHT.  

NUMEROUS WITNESSES REPORTED SEEING THE HELICOPTER FLYING BETWEEN 300 AND 500 FEET AGL AND HEADING NORTH BEFORE EXPERIENCING AN IN FLIGHT BREAKUP AND IMPACTING TERRAIN.  ONE WITNESS REPORTED HEARING WHAT HE THOUGHT ""…WAS THE ENGINE MAKING A LOUD NOISE, LIKE A LARGE DIESEL TRUCK ROARING, THEN THERE WAS A LARGE, LOUD BANG NORTH OF MY BARN AND SOME PIECES FELL TO THE GROUND.""  A SECOND WITNESS REPORTED HEARING THE HELICOPTER ""...MAKE A LOUD BANG, THEN WATCHED IT FALL FROM THE SKY.""  A THIRD WITNESS REPORTED SEEING A SMALL HELICOPTER FLYING OFF TO HIS LEFT, ""...AND [IN] A MATTER OF SECONDS I SAW SMOKE FROM WHERE THE HELICOPTER WAS FLYING.  I SAW THE AIRCRAFT CRASH INTO THE FIELD.""  A FOURTH WITNESS REPORTED SEEING A SMALL HELICOPTER FLYING NORTH FROM AWO, ""...AND AS IT DISAPPEARED INTO THE DISTANCE I HEARD A LARGE PROLONGED 'SHUDDERY BOOM,' AND THEN NO MORE HELICOPTER ENGINE NOISE.""

THE NTSB IIC AND TWO FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) AVIATION SAFETY INSPECTORS TRAVELED TO THE ACCIDENT SITE.  THE HELICOPTER WAS LOCATED IN AN OPEN FIELD APPROXIMATELY 2 NAUTICAL MILES NORTH OF AWO.  THERE WAS NO POST CRASH FIRE.  AFTER AN INITIAL ONSITE EXAMINATION OF THE AIRCRAFT AND DOCUMENTATION OF THE DEBRIS FIELD, THE HELICOPTER AND ALL ASSOCIATED COMPONENTS WERE RECOVERED AND MOVED TO A SECURED LOCATION AT THE ARLINGTON MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, WHERE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE NTSB AND THE FAA WOULD EXAMINE THE WRECKAGE IN GREATER DETAIL AT A LATER DATE. 

THE HELICOPTER, WHICH HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY THE PILOT-RATED STUDENT THREE DAYS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT, HAD BEEN REBUILT BY A LOCAL CERTIFICATED AIRFRAME AND POWERPLANT MECHANIC.  THE MECHANIC PERSONALLY DELIVERED THE HELICOPTER TO THE PILOT-RATED STUDENT AT APPROXIMATELY 1800 ON NOVEMBER 24TH.  IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WITH THE IIC ON NOVEMBER 28TH, THE MECHANIC REPORTED THAT ON NOVEMBER 16TH AND 17TH, HE CONDUCTED TEST FIGHTS OF THE HELICOPTER WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF ANOTHER PILOT.  THE TEST PILOT STATED IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WITH THE IIC THAT HE OBSERVED NO ANOMALIES WITH THE AIRCRAFT DURING THE TEST FLIGHT.  THE TEST PILOT ALSO REVEALED THAT ON NOVEMBER 25TH, THE DAY AFTER THE NEW OWNER PURCHASED THE HELICOPTER, HE PERSONALLY FLEW WITH HIM FOR APPROXIMATELY 45 MINUTES, LETTING THE PILOT/OWNER TAKE CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT DURING VARIOUS PORTIONS OF THE FLIGHT.  ADDITIONALLY, THE MECHANIC HAD A SECOND PILOT CONDUCT A TEST FLIGHT ON NOVEMBER 24TH.  IN A WRITTEN REPORT TO THE IIC, THE SECOND TEST PILOT STATED THAT THE MECHANIC REQUESTED THAT HE TAKE THE HELICOPTER UP AND PUT IT INTO AN AUTOROTATION, CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE ADJUSTED PROPERLY.  THE TEST PILOT REPORTED TAKING THE HELICOPTER UP TO 1,000 FEET, DROPPING THE COLLECTIVE, AND OBSERVING THE ROTOR RPM TO BE LOW.  THE PILOT STATED, ""I LANDED AND REPORTED MY FINDINGS TO [THE MECHANIC], [WHO] MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS.  I DID ANOTHER FLIGHT AND FOUND THE ROTOR RPM WAS NOW WHERE IT SHOULD BE.  AT THE TIME OF MY FLIGHT THIS SHIP HAD THE SAME DOORS ON IT THAT I FLY WITH (TECH-TOOL DOORS).""  THE MECHANIC REPORTED THAT THE TOTAL TIME FOR ALL OF THE TEST FLIGHTS WAS 4.1 HOURS.  

IN A STATEMENT PROVIDED TO THE IIC DATED NOVEMBER 29, 2004, THE MECHANIC REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER'S ANNUAL INSPECTION WAS COMPLETED AND THE AIRCRAFT WAS DELIVERED TO THE PILOT-RATED STUDENT ABOUT 1800 ON NOVEMBER 24TH.  THE MECHANIC FURTHER REPORTED THAT THE TECH-TOOL DOORS WERE PROPERLY INSTALLED AND THAT THE [DOOR] PINS WERE ALL IN PLACE.  THE MECHANIC STATED THAT ON NOVEMBER 24TH, PRIOR TO DELIVERING THE HELICOPTER TO THE PILOT-RATED STUDENT, ""...I TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO REINSTALL THE ORIGINAL FACTORY DOORS BEFORE FLYING THE HELICOPTER, BECAUSE I HAD NOT FINISHED THE WEIGHT AND BALANCE FOR THE TECH-TOOL DOORS.""   

TWO WITNESSES PROVIDED THE IIC WITH STATEMENTS RELATIVE TO THEIR PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS DURING THE DAYS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.  THE FIRST WITNESS REPORTED THAT AFTER OBSERVING THE HELICOPTER BEING TEST FLOWN ON NOVEMBER 24TH AND PUT BACK IN FRONT OF ITS HANGAR, HE NOTICED THAT THE [DOOR] PINS WERE NOT IN THE DOORS.

AN EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER'S DRIVELINE REVEALED THAT THE DRIVE BELTS WERE BOTH INTACT AND IN PLACE.  NEITHER BELT EXHIBITED INDICATIONS OF ROLLING OR TWISTING.  THE LOWER ACTUATOR BEARING WAS TRAPPED BY THE CRUSHED COOLING FAN AND EARTH AND COULD NOT BE CHECKED FOR FREE ROTATION.  THE BELT TENSION ACTUATOR WAS FRACTURED AT THE UPPER BEARING ATTACHMENT POINT.  THE UPPER ACTUATOR BEARING WAS FREE TO ROTATE A FEW DEGREES, BUT WAS CONSTRAINED BY THE FORWARD FLEX COUPLING CONTACTING THE FRAME.  THE FORWARD FLEX COUPLING WAS BENT, BUT INTACT.  THE MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX CONTAINED BLUE OIL AND WAS FREE TO ROTATE AT LEAST ONE FULL TURN OF THE OUTPUT SHAFT.  THE MAST TUBE APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, BUT WAS FRACTURED AT THE TOP OF THE GEARBOX.  THE MAST WAS BENT AT THE TOP OF THE MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX.  THE DROOP STOPS FOR BOTH MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE INTACT AND IN PLACE.  MAST BUMPING WAS INDICATED AS THE RESULT OF DROOP STOP TUSKS AND ROOT FITTING HUB CONTACT.  MAST DAMAGE WAS ALSO OBSERVED UNDER THE TEETER STOPS.  

MAIN ROTOR BLADE SN 8772A WAS INTACT AND EXHIBITED TRAILING EDGE COMPRESSION BUCKLING.  IT WAS BENT SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD IN THE INBOARD PORTION AND UPWARD NEAR THE TIP.  STREAKS OF A RED SUBSTANCE WERE PRESENT NEAR THE LEADING EDGE OF THE BLADE, ABOUT 33 TO 40 INCHES FROM THE BLADE TIP.  THERE WAS ALSO A STREAK OF A RED SUBSTANCE ON THE BLADE'S UPPER SURFACE APPROXIMATELY 80 INCHES FROM THE BLADE'S TIP.  MAIN ROTOR BLADE SN 8786A WAS FRACTURED APPROXIMATELY 2 FEET FROM THE CONING BOLT.  THE AFT PORTION OF THE BLADE HAD SEPARATED FROM THE SPAR OVER A SPAN OF ABOUT 3 FEET OUTBOARD FROM THE SPAR SEPARATION.  STREAKS OF A RED SUBSTANCE WERE OBSERVED NEAR THE LEADING EDGE OF THE BLADE IN AN AREA FROM APPROXIMATELY 22 INCHES TO APPROXIMATELY 32 INCHES FROM THE BLADE TIP.    

THE INTERMEDIATE FLEX COUPLING WAS DETACHED, AND THE FLEXPLATE ARMS HAD SEPARATED FROM THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVESHAFT YOKE.

TAIL ROTOR BLADE SN 5927D EXHIBITED CHIPS IN THE PAINT NEAR THE LEADING EDGE.

THE COCKPIT/CABIN AREA WAS DESTROYED.  COCKPIT DOCUMENTATION OF THE AIRCRAFT'S INSTRUMENTS WAS NOT POSSIBLE ON SITE.  

THE AIRCRAFT'S RIGHT SKID WAS VISIBLE LYING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT IMBEDDED","THIS WAS THE PILOT-RATED STUDENT'S FIRST INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT IN THE RECENTLY REBUILT HELICOPTER, WHICH HE PURCHASED THREE DAYS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT.  ABOUT 5 MINUTES AFTER THE HELICOPTER'S DEPARTURE ON THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT, WITNESSES REPORTED HEARING A LOUD BANG AND WATCHING THE HELICOPTER FALL TO THE GROUND.  THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED TERRAIN IN AN APPROXIMATELY LEVEL ATTITUDE, COMING TO REST IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION.  THERE WAS NO POSTCRASH FIRE.  ALL MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE HELICOPTER WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AND RECOVERED BEFORE BEING MOVED TO A SECURED STORAGE FACILITY.  BOTH OF THE HELICOPTER'S DOORS SEPARATED FROM THE AIRCRAFT IN FLIGHT.  THE RIGHT DOOR WAS RECOVERED INTACT AND NOT DAMAGED, WHILE THE LEFT DOOR WAS ACCOUNTED FOR IN MULTIPLE FRAGMENTED PIECES, INCLUDING THE DOOR HANDLE AND FRAME, AND THE DOOR LATCHING MECHANISM.  BOTH TAIL ROTOR BLADES WERE LOCATED 500 TO 600 FEET PRIOR TO THE MAIN IMPACT POINT, WITH ONE BLADE EXHIBITING TWO LARGE IMPACT AREAS NEAR THE TIP OF THE LEADING EDGE.  ONE IMPACT AREA WAS MORE ROUNDED THAN THE OTHER, WITH THE OTHER IMPACT AREA BEING BROADER AND VERY FLAT.  EXAMINATIONS OF PAINT TRANSFERS REVEALED THAT THE MATERIAL ON THE LEADING EDGE OF A PIECE OF MAIN ROTOR BLADE AND ON THE DOOR LATCHING MECHANISM WERE TRANSFERRED PAINT FROM THE TAILBOOM, AND THAT THE YELLOW PAINT ON THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS SIMILAR TO THE PAINT FROM THE TAIL ROTOR BLADE AND LIKELY FROM THE SAME SOURCE.  THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS PRECEDING THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT, AS WELL AS THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE EXAMINED DURING THE INVESTIGATION, INDICATES THAT THE DOOR PINS WERE NOT INSTALLED PRIOR TO THE FLIGHT.  PHYSICAL EVIDENCE CONSISTENT WITH THE HELICOPTER'S MAIN ROTOR DIVERGING FROM ITS NORMAL PLANE OF ROTATION AND STRIKING THE LEFT WINDSCREEN WAS OBSERVED IN THE FORM OF AN AREA OF BLACK TRANSFER MATERIAL, WHICH MEASURED 24 INCHES BY 5 INCHES ON THE UPPER LEFT OUTBOARD AREA OF THE LEFT WINDSCREEN.  THE INITIATING EVENT THAT PRODUCED THE MAIN ROTOR DIVERGENCE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED.","THE DIVERGENCE OF THE MAIN ROTOR FROM ITS NORMAL PLANE OF ROTATION FOR AN UNDETERMINED REASON, RESULTING IN ROTOR CONTACT WITH THE AIRCRAFT'S LEFT WINDSCREEN.  THE FAILURE OF THE DOOR PINS TO BE INSTALLED WAS A FACTOR."

ON OCTOBER 7, 2005, AT 2342 EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME, AN AGUSTA 109E, N7YL, OPERATED BY CJ SYSTEMS AVIATION GROUP INC., WAS DESTROYED WHEN IT IMPACTED TREES AND TERRAIN IN SMETHPORT, PENNSYLVANIA, WHILE PERFORMING AN INSTRUMENT APPROACH TO BRADFORD REGIONAL AIRPORT (BFD), BRADFORD, PENNSYLVANIA.  THE CERTIFICATED COMMERCIAL PILOT WAS FATALLY INJURED.  NIGHT INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS (IMC) PREVAILED, AND AN INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES (IFR) FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE FLIGHT THAT ORIGINATED FROM KANE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL (PA91), KANE, PENNSYLVANIA, AT 2324.  THE POSITIONING FLIGHT WAS CONDUCTED UNDER 14 CFR PART 91.

IN AN INTERVIEW, A MISSION FLIGHT NURSE STATED THAT HE AND ANOTHER NURSE WERE ONBOARD THE HELICOPTER DURING A POSITIONING FLIGHT FROM THEIR BASE IN HARBORCREEK, PENNSYLVANIA, TO KANE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL.  UPON ARRIVAL AT THE HOSPITAL, HE AND THE OTHER NURSE DEPLANED TO PREPARE A PATIENT FOR TRANSPORT TO PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, WHILE THE HELICOPTER DEPARTED FOR BRADFORD AIRPORT TO REFUEL.

EXAMINATION OF RADAR AND VOICE COMMUNICATION DATA PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) REVEALED THAT THE HELICOPTER DEPARTED KANE HOSPITAL HELIPAD AND TRACKED THE COPTER GPS 246 DEPARTURE PROCEDURE COURSE.  THE PILOT CONTACTED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC), AT 2324:47, STATED THAT HE HAD DEPARTED THE HOSPITAL, AND WAS ""VFR TO UH BRADFORD THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED CLIMBING TO FIVE.""

OVER THE NEXT 4 MINUTES, THE PILOT REQUESTED THE INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM (ILS) RUNWAY 32 APPROACH TO BRADFORD REGIONAL AIRPORT, AND HE AND THE CONTROLLER DISCUSSED WHETHER THE HELICOPTER WOULD BE VECTORED TO THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE OR IF THE FULL APPROACH PROCEDURE WOULD BE FLOWN.

THE CONTROLLER STATED, ""SAY YOUR HEADING I'VE GOT YOU HEADING THE WRONG WAY FOR BRADFORD.""  THE PILOT REPLIED THAT HE WAS HEADING 246 DEGREES, WHICH WAS PRESCRIBED IN THE PROCEDURE, BUT THE CONTROLLER QUESTIONED THE RESPONSE.  THE PILOT REAFFIRMED HIS INTENTION TO FLY TO BRADFORD, AND THE CONTROLLER ASSIGNED A 040-DEGREE HEADING.

THE PILOT ACKNOWLEDGED THE INSTRUCTIONS; THE HELICOPTER THEN REVERSED DIRECTION, AND ASSUMED A NORTHEASTERLY TRACK.  ABOUT 3 MINUTES LATER, THE CONTROLLER STATED, ""FLY HEADING OF ZERO EIGHT FIVE RADAR VECTORS RUNWAY THREE TWO I-L-S.""

THE PILOT ACKNOWLEDGED THE RADIO CALL, AND THE HELICOPTER ASSUMED AN EASTERLY TRACK.

AT 2339:01, THE CONTROLLER STATED, ""SEVEN YANKEE LIMA FLY HEADING OF THREE FOUR ZERO JOIN THE LOCALIZER REPORT ESTABLISHED PLEASE.""  AT THAT TIME, THE HELICOPTER WAS AT 5,000 FEET, ON AN EASTERLY TRACK, ABOUT 1 MILE WEST OF THE RUNWAY EXTENDED CENTERLINE, ABOUT 150 KNOTS GROUNDSPEED.  THE PILOT ACKNOWLEDGED THE INSTRUCTIONS.

THE RADAR TRACK DEPICTED THE HELICOPTER ON AN EASTERLY HEADING AS IT FLEW THROUGH THE 322-DEGREE FINAL APPROACH COURSE, ABOUT 4 MILES OUTSIDE OF THE OUTER MARKER.

AT 2340:03, THE CONTROLLER ADVISED THE PILOT THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS ""ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE I-L-S,"" AND THE PILOT ACKNOWLEDGED THE CALL.  AT 2341:09, THE CONTROLLER ASKED IF THE PILOT WAS ESTABLISHED ON THE ILS.  THE PILOT RESPONDED THAT HE WAS ""RECAPTURING.""  THE CONTROLLER THEN ASKED IF THE PILOT HAD SAID ""AFFIRMATIVE,"" AND THE PILOT REPLIED ""AFFIRMATIVE.""  AT 0341:19, THE CONTROLLER TRANSMITTED, ""LIFEGUARD SEVEN YANKEE LIMA ROGER CLEARED I-L-S THREE TWO UH RUNWAY AT BRADFORD UH MAINTAIN FOUR THOUSAND FEET AND UH REPORT CANCELLATION ON THIS FREQUENCY...""  THE PILOT READ BACK THE CLEARANCE AT 0341:33.  THERE WERE NO FURTHER TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE HELICOPTER.

WHEN THE PILOT REPLIED ""RECAPTURING"" THE CONTROLLER INSISTED THE PILOT RESPOND ""AFFIRMATIVE,"" WHICH THE PILOT SUBSEQUENTLY DID.

AT THE TIME THE CONTROLLER ADVISED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS RIGHT OF THE LOCALIZER COURSE, THE RADAR TRACK DEPICTED THE HELICOPTER ABOUT MIDWAY THROUGH A LEFT TURN TO ABOUT A 310-DEGREE HEADING, AT 5,000 FEET, AND ABOUT 1 MILE EAST OF THE RUNWAY CENTERLINE.

THE HELICOPTER'S TRACK APPROACHED THE LOCALIZER COURSE CENTERLINE, AND THEN TURNED SHARPLY AWAY FROM, AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE INBOUND COURSE.  THE RADAR TARGET SHOWED AN APPROXIMATE TRACK OF 100 DEGREES, WHEN THE TARGET DISAPPEARED.  DURING THE 1 MINUTE AND 10 SECONDS FOLLOWING THE PILOT'S ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE 4,000-FOOT ALTITUDE ASSIGNMENT, THE HELICOPTER DESCENDED ONLY 300 FEET, SLOWED TO APPROXIMATELY 65 KNOTS GROUNDSPEED, AND TURNED 140 DEGREES RIGHT OF COURSE.

THE FINAL THREE PLOTS OF THE RADAR TRACK SHOWED A SHARP LEFT TURN BACK TOWARDS THE LOCALIZER COURSE, AND AN APPROXIMATE GROUND SPEED OF 55 KNOTS.  THE LAST RADAR PLOT WAS APPROXIMATELY OVER THE CRASH SITE AT 4,300 FEET, ABOUT 1 MILE EAST OF THE EXTENDED RUNWAY CENTERLINE, AND 4 MILES FROM THE AIRPORT.  

IN AN INTERVIEW, A WITNESS THAT LIVED APPROXIMATELY 1 MILE FROM THE CRASH SITE SAID THAT HE DID NOT SEE THE HELICOPTER, BUT HEARD IT PASS OVERHEAD.  HE SAID HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE SOUND, AS HE HAD LIVED CLOSE TO THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE FOR RUNWAY 32 FOR MANY YEARS.

THE WITNESS SAID THE SOUND WAS LOUDER THAN USUAL, AND HE FELT THE HELICOPTER WAS CLOSER TO HIS HOME AND LOWER THAN USUAL.  THE WITNESS DESCRIBED THE SOUND AS SMOOTH AND CONTINUOUS, WITH NO CHANGE IN AIRCRAFT NOISE.  AFTER THE HELICOPTER OVER FLEW HIS POSITION, HE HEARD THE SOUND OF AN EXPLOSION.

ON OCTOBER 8, 2005, THE FAA GENERATED AN ALERT NOTICE AT 0101, AND A GROUND SEARCH FOR THE HELICOPTER BEGAN IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF OCTOBER 8, 2005.  A SEARCH BY AIR WAS NOT CONDUCTED DUE TO WEATHER.  THE HELICOPTER WRECKAGE WAS FOUND ON OCTOBER 9, 2005, AND WAS EXAMINED AT THE SITE ON OCTOBER 10, 2005.

THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED DURING THE HOURS OF DARKNESS APPROXIMATELY 40 DEGREES, 53 MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE, AND 78 DEGREES, 06 MINUTES WEST LONGITUDE.

PERSONNEL INFORMATION

THE PILOT HELD A COMMERCIAL PILOT CERTIFICATE WITH RATINGS FOR ROTORCRAFT HELICOPTER AND INSTRUMENT HELICOPTER.  THE COMMERCIAL CERTIFICATE WAS ISSUED FEBRUARY 10, 1979, AND THE INSTRUMENT RATING WAS ADDED JUNE 18, 1997.  HIS MOST RECENT FAA SECOND-CLASS MEDICAL CERTIFICATE WAS ISSUED ON OCTOBER 19, 2004, AND HE REPORTED 9,616 TOTAL HOURS OF FLIGHT EXPERIENCE ON THAT DATE.

THE PILOT'S LOGBOOK WAS NOT RECOVERED; HOWEVER, SOME FLIGHT TIMES WERE EXTRACTED FROM COMPANY RECORDS.  IN THE 90 DAYS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT, THE PILOT LOGGED 56 HOURS, ALL OF WHICH WAS IN THE AUGUSTA 109E.  IN THIS TIME PERIOD, HE LOGGED 25 HOURS OF FLIGHT EXPERIENCE AT NIGHT, 3 HOURS OF SIMULATED INSTRUMENT EXPERIENCE, AND 3 HOURS OF ACTUAL INSTRUMENT FLIGHT EXPERIENCE.

THE COMPANY REPORTED THAT THE PILOT HAD 110 TOTAL HOURS OF INSTRUMENT FLIGHT EXPERIENCE, AND ESTIMATED THAT OF THIS 70 HOURS WERE SIMULATED INSTRUMENT FLIGHT EXPERIENCE, AND 40 HOURS WERE ACTUAL INSTRUMENT FLIGHT EXPERIENCE.  LATER, THE COMPANY REPORTED THAT THE PILOT HAD ACCRUED 100 HOURS OF INSTRUMENT FLYING EXPERIENCE, 10 HOURS OF WHICH WAS SIMULATED.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER WAS MANUFACTURED IN 2001, AND HAD ACCRUED 1,905 TOTAL AIRFRAME HOURS.  IT WAS MAINTAINED UNDER AN APPROVED AIRCRAFT INSPECTION PROGRAM (AAIP), AND ITS MOST RECENT INSPECTION WAS COMPLETED AUGUST 5, 2005.

THE HELICOPTER WAS EQUIPPED WITH AN INTEGRATED FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM (IFCS).  THE SYSTEM PROVIDED ATTITUDE AUTOMATIC STABILIZATION AND AUTOMATIC PATH CONTROL.  BOTH STABILIZATION AND AUTOMATIC PATH COMPUTATION WERE ACTUATED THROUGH THE HELIPILOT (AUTOPILOT) SYSTEM AND THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR SYSTEM.

A REVIEW OF MAINTENANCE RECORDS REVEALED NUMEROUS ENTRIES RELATED TO AUTOPILOT MALFUNCTIONS AND FAILURES.  THE MALFUNCTIONS INCLUDED ERRATIC COMMAND BARS ON PILOT AND COPILOT DISPLAYS, AND UNCOMMANDED PITCH AND ROLL OSCILLATIONS THAT OCCURRED DURING PREFLIGHT CHECKS AND ALSO IN FLIGHT.  OVER A 2-YEAR SPAN, 10 AUTOPILOT COMPUTERS WERE CHANGED ON THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER DUE TO THEIR EXPOSURE TO ""HIGH VIBRATION LEVELS.""

A SERVICE BULLETIN (109EP-51) WAS RELEASED FEBRUARY 9, 2005, TO ADDRESS THE VIBRATION ISSUES WITH THE INSTALLATION OF SHOCK-ISOLATING MOUNTS ON THE MOUNTING TRAYS FOR THE AUTOPILOT COMPUTERS.  ACCORDING TO THE SITE MECHANIC WHERE THE HELICOPTER WAS BASED, HE DIDN'T RECALL HAVING TO CHANGE ANY COMPUTERS ONCE THE SERVICE BULLETIN WAS APPLIED.

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

AT 2337, THE WEATHER REPORTED AT BRADFORD REGIONAL AIRPORT INCLUDED AN OVERCAST CEILING AT 600 FEET, WITH 2 1/2 MILES OF VISIBILITY IN MIST.  THE TEMPERATURE WAS 50 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, AND THE DEW POINT WAS 48 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED HEAVILY WOODED TERRAIN ABOUT 2,000 FEET ELEVATION AND ALL MAJOR COMPONENTS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE SCENE.  THE INITIAL IMPACT POINT WAS IN A TREETOP ABOUT 50 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND ON LEVEL TERRAIN.  THE WRECKAGE PATH WAS ABOUT 180 FEET LONG, AND ORIENTED ABOUT 100 DEGREES.  THE HELICOPTER WAS FRAGMENTED, BURNED, AND MELTED ALONG THE ENTIRE PATH.  THERE WERE SEVERAL PIECES OF ANGULARLY CUT WOOD ALONG THE WRECKAGE PATH, AND SEVERAL TREES WITH FIRE DAMAGE AND LONG ANGULAR SLICES ALONG THEIR TRUNKS.  

THE WRECKAGE PATH WAS DOCUMENTED AT 1-FOOT INCREMENTS CALLED WRECKAGE POINTS (WP).  AT WP 33, A LARGE TREE, ABOUT 15 INCHES IN DIAMETER, WAS BROKEN OFF ABOUT 25 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.  SHEETS OF COMPOSITE MATERIAL WERE EMBEDDED VERTICALLY INTO THE TRUNK FRACTURE.

THE VERTICAL FIN WAS AT WP 41.  THE TAILBOOM WAS ABEAM THE VERTICAL FIN, ABOUT 30 FEET RIGHT OF THE WRECKAGE PATH CENTERLINE.  STRUCTURE THAT CONTAINED THE NUMBER 1 HANGER BEARING WAS ALSO AT WP 41, 25 FEET LEFT OF CENTERLINE.  BOTH THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT ANTENNA FROM THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WERE DESTROYED BY IMPACT AND POSTCRASH FIRE.

THE MAIN WRECKAGE, WHICH CONSISTED MOSTLY OF THE MAIN TRANSMISSION WITH THE MAST AND ROTOR HEAD ATTACHED, WAS ENTANGLED AT THE BASE OF THREE TREES AT WP 66.  THE COCKPIT AND CABIN AREA WERE CONSUMED BY FIRE, AND ALL THE FLIGHT AND SYSTEM INSTRUMENTS HAD BEEN DESTROYED.

BECAUSE OF IMPACT AND FIRE DAMAGE, CONTROL CONTINUITY COULD NOT BE ESTABLISHED.  ALL FLIGHT CONTROLS, TUBES, AND BELLCRANKS THAT WERE EXAMINED DISPLAYED IMPACT DAMAGE AND FAILURES CONSISTENT WITH OVERLOAD.

ALL FOUR ROTOR BLADES WERE LOCATED AT THE SITE.  THEY WERE EXTENSIVELY DAMAGED BY IMPACT AND FIRE.  THE RED, WHITE, AND YELLOW BLADE GRIPS WERE STILL ATTACHED TO THE ROTOR HEAD.  THE BLUE BLADE GRIP, WITH DAMPER ATTACHED, WAS LOCATED ABOUT 12 FEET TO THE RIGHT OF THE TRANSMISSION AND ROTOR HEAD.

ALL FOUR MAIN ROTOR BLADE SPARS WERE EXPOSED, WITH THE ASSOCIATED COMPOSITE AND HONEYCOMB MATERIAL SCATTERED ALONG THE WRECKAGE PATH.

EXAMINATION OF THE ROTOR HEAD REVEALED THAT THE RED AND WHITE PITCH CHANGE LINKS WERE STILL ATTACHED TO THEIR HUBS AND THE SWASHPLATE.  THE PITCH CHANGE LINK FOR THE YELLOW BLADE WAS BROKEN AT THE SWASHPLATE, AND THE BLUE PITCH CHANGE LINK WAS BROKEN AT THE BLADE GRIP.  ALL FRACTURES WERE CONSISTENT WITH OVERLOAD.

THE RED, WHITE, AND YELLOW DAMPERS WERE STILL ATTACHED TO THE ROTOR HEAD, BUT SEPARATED FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE BLADE GRIPS.  THE BLUE MAIN ROTOR BLADE DAMPER WAS SEPARATED FROM THE ROTOR HEAD, BUT STILL ATTACHED TO ITS BLADE GRIP.  

THE ENGINES WERE ENTANGLED IN AIRCRAFT STRUCTURE AT WP 75, AND BOTH WERE EXTENSIVELY DAMAGED BY FIRE.  THE NUMBER ONE ENGINE WAS LARGELY INTACT.  THE NUMBER TWO ENGINE WAS BROKEN OPEN, WITH INTERNAL COMPONENTS SCATTERED ON THE GROUND.

CONTINUITY OF THE POWERTRAIN COULD NOT BE ESTABLISHED.  THE COMBINING GEARBOX WAS FRACTURED INTO SEVERAL PIECES, AND THE OIL COOLER IMPELLER WAS EXPOSED.  ALL DRIVE COUPLINGS AND DRIVESHAFTS SHOWED FRACTURE SURFACES THAT WERE CONSISTENT WITH IMPACT AND TORSIONAL OVERLOAD.

A SECTION OF TREE TRUNK, ABOUT 6 FEET LONG AND CONSISTENT WITH THE FRACTURED TREE AT WP 33, WAS FOUND 180 FEET BEYOND THE INITIAL POINT OF IMPACT.  THE TRUNK SECTION WAS ABOUT 15 INCHES IN DIAMETER.  THE BARK AND WOOD ALONG ONE SIDE WAS SHAVED CLEAN AND DISPLAYED ANGULAR SLICES.  THERE WAS AIRCRAFT STRUCTURAL SHEET METAL AND ASSOCIATED HARDWARE EMBEDDED IN THE WOOD.

TESTS AND RESEARCH

THE ENGINES WERE REEXAMINED AT TURBOMECA, USA, GRAND PRAIRIE, TEXAS, ON JANUARY 19, 2006, UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE FAA.

EXAMINATION OF THE NUMBER ONE ENGINE REVEALED ROTATIONAL TEARING OF THE COUPLING AT THE ACCESSORY DRIVE GEARBOX.  THE SINGLE-STAGE HIGH-PRESSURE TURBINE SHOWED SIGNS OF RUB ON NOZZLE SEGMENTS AT THE 1:00 O'CLOCK POSITION.  THE POWER TURBINE SHAFT HAD A TORSIONAL TEAR CONSISTENT WITH ROTATION AND IMPACT.

EXAMINATION OF THE NUMBER TWO ENGINE REVEALED THAT THE INLET AXIAL COMPRESSOR BLADES DISPLAYED IMPACT DAMAGE AND ROTATIONAL TEARING.  THE POWER TURBINE SHAFT WAS SHEARED AND WORN SMOOTH FROM ROTATION AT THE ACCESSORY DRIVE GEARBOX AND THE GAS GENERATOR CONNECTION.

COMMUNICATION

A SAFETY BOARD AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SPECIALIST CONVENED AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL GROUP AT CLEVELAND AIR ROUTE TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER (ZOB), OBERLIN, OHIO, ON OCTOBER 18, 2005.  THE GROUP REVIEWED RADAR AND VOICE COMMUNICATION RECORDINGS, COLLECTED DOCUMENTATION, CONDUCTED INTERVIEWS, AND THE SAFETY BOARD SPECIALIST COMPLETED A FACTUAL REPORT.

WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE ILS RUNWAY 32 APPROACH, THE CONTROLLER WAS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE GLIDESLOPE ALTITUDE AT THE POINT THAT THE HELICOPTER CROSSED THE ILS LOCALIZER.  GIVEN AN APPROACH CHART, HE WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE GLIDESLOPE ALTITUDE AT THE OUTER MARKER AS 3,333 FEET.  WHEN HE ISSUED THE APPROACH CLEARANCE, THE CONTROLLER STATED, ""…CLEARED ILS THREE TWO UH RUNWAY AT BRADFORD UH MAINTAIN FOUR THOUSAND FEET.""  THE CONTROLLER WAS UNABLE TO EXPLAIN WHAT HE INTENDED BY APPENDING THE 4,000 FOOT RESTRICTION TO THE APPROACH CLEARANCE.  HE ALSO STATED THAT WHEN HE ISSUED THE APPROACH CLEARANCE HE HAD NO FEEL FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HELICOPTER'S ALTITUDE AND THE GLIDESLOPE ALTITUDE AT THE HELICOPTER'S LOCATION.

ACCORDING TO FAAO 7110.65, THE CONTROLLER SHALL, ""ASSIGN HEADINGS THAT WILL PERMIT FINAL APPROACH COURSE INTERCEPTION ON A TRACK THAT DOES NOT EXCEED THE INTERCEPTION ANGLES SPECIFIED IN THE TBL 5-9-1.""  THE APPROPRIATE INTERCEPT ANGLE VALUES WERE 30 DEGREES FOR FIXED-WING AIRCRAFT AND 45 DEGREES FOR HELICOPTERS.

ACCORDING TO FAAO 7110.65, PARAGRAPH 5-9-1(B), CONTROLLERS SHOULD POSITION AIRCRAFT AS FOLLOWS: ""FOR A PRECISION APPROACH, AT AN ALTITUDE NOT ABOVE THE GLIDESLOPE/GLIDEPATH OR BELOW THE MINIMUM GLIDESLOPE INTERCEPT ALTITUDE SPECIFIED ON THE APPROACH PROCEDURE CHART.""  

THE FAA CONDUCTED A POSTACCIDENT FLIGHT INSPECTION OF THE ILS RUNWAY 32 APPROACH AT BRADFORD REGIONAL AIRPORT, AND THE RESULTS WERE ""SATISFACTORY,"" WITH NO DEFICIENCIES NOTED.

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

THE FAA BIOAERONAUTICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH LABORATORY, OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, PERFORMED THE TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE PILOT.  CHLORPHENIRAMINE, AN ANTIHISTAMINE, WAS DETECTED IN THE HEART AND LIVER.

THE ANTIHISTAMINE CHLORPHENIRAMINE WAS AVAILABLE OVER-THE-COUNTER UNDER THE COMMERCIAL NAME CHLOR-TRIMETON.  ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER, THE SIDE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH CHLORPHENIRAMINE INCLUDED HEADACHE, FATIGUE, AND DIZZINESS.  AMONG THE WARNINGS LISTED FOR CONSUMERS WAS, ""USE CAUTION WHEN DRIVING A MOTOR VEHICLE OR OPERATING MACHINERY.""

ACCORDING TO HIS SUPERVISOR, THE PILOT WAS VERY PHYSICALLY FIT, BUT ""HAD A SINUS CONDITION ON OCCASION.""  THE FLIGHT NURSE ALSO STATED THE PILOT ""ALWAYS SEEMED TO HAVE SINUS PROBLEMS.""

THE MOUNT NITTANY MEDICAL CENTER, STATE COLLEGE, PENNSYLVANIA, PERFORMED AN AUTOPSY ON THE PILOT.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ACCORDING TO THE OPERATOR'S DIRECTOR OF TRAINING, AS WELL AS PILOTS EMPLOYED BY THE AIRFRAME MANUFACTURER, AFTER THE HELICOPTER FLEW THROUGH THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE, AND TURNED TO THE WEST, THE AUTOPILOT COULD STILL CAPTURE THE LOCALIZER COURSE.  HOWEVER, ONCE THE HELICOPTER WAS IN THE VICINITY OF THE LOCALIZER COURSE, AND ABOVE THE GLIDESLOPE, THE AUTOPILOT WOULD BE UNABLE TO CAPTURE THE GLIDESLOPE.

IF ALTITUDE HOLD REMAINED ENGAGED AT THAT POINT OF THE FLIGHT, AND THE PILOT REDUCED COLLECTIVE TO CAPTURE THE GLIDESLOPE, THE AUTOPILOT WOULD ADJUST PITCH IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN THE SELECTED ALTITUDE.

THE FLIGHT SAFETY FOUNDATION PUBLICATION HELICOPTER SAFETY, MAY-JUNE 1997, HELICOPTER AUTOPILOTS DEMAND CAREFUL MANAGEMENT, DISCUSSED SOME SCENARIOS OF ""AUTOPILOT MISMANAGEMENT.""

ONE SCENARIO DESCRIBED WAS IN A FLIGHT SIMULATOR,","THE SINGLE-PILOT HELICOPTER WAS FLYING UNDER INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES IN NIGHT INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS.  THE CONTROLLER INSTRUCTED THE PILOT TO FLY HEADING 340 DEGREES TO INTERCEPT THE LOCALIZER COURSE FOR AN INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM APPROACH.  AT THAT TIME, THE HELICOPTER WAS ABOUT 1.5 MILES FROM THE LOCALIZER CENTERLINE, HEADED 095 DEGREES, ABOUT 150 KNOTS GROUNDSPEED.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE HELICOPTER FLEW THROUGH AND ENDED UP WELL EAST OF THE 322-DEGREE LOCALIZER COURSE.  DURING THE RESULTING 135-DEGREE TURN TO REJOIN THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE, THE PILOT WAS ISSUED AN APPROACH CLEARANCE, BUT TOLD TO ""MAINTAIN 4,000.""  THE HELICOPTER'S TRACK APPROACHED THE RUNWAY CENTERLINE, AND THEN TURNED SHARPLY AWAY FROM, AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE INBOUND COURSE.  THE TRACK SHOWED AN APPROXIMATE HEADING OF 100 DEGREES, WHEN THE RADAR TARGET DISAPPEARED.  DURING THE 1 MINUTE AND 10 SECONDS FOLLOWING THE PILOT'S ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE 4,000-FOOT ALTITUDE ASSIGNMENT, THE HELICOPTER DESCENDED ONLY 300 FEET, SLOWED TO APPROXIMATELY 65 KNOTS GROUNDSPEED, AND TURNED 140 DEGREES RIGHT OF COURSE.  AT THE POINT WHERE THE HELICOPTER RE-INTERCEPTED THE LOCALIZER, THE AUTOPILOT WAS CAPABLE OF CAPTURING THE LOCALIZER, BUT INCAPABLE OF CAPTURING THE GLIDESLOPE.  IF ALTITUDE HOLD REMAINED ENGAGED AT THAT POINT OF THE FLIGHT, AND THE PILOT REDUCED COLLECTIVE TO INITIATE A DESCENT, THE AUTOPILOT WOULD ADJUST PITCH IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN THE SELECTED ALTITUDE.  SIMILAR SCENARIOS IN HELICOPTERS AND FLIGHT SIMULATORS HAVE RESULTED IN UNUSUAL ATTITUDES AND ZERO AIRSPEED DESCENTS TO THE GROUND.  THE PILOT HAD ACCRUED 9,616 TOTAL HOURS OF FLIGHT EXPERIENCE.  HE HAD 100 TOTAL HOURS OF INSTRUMENT FLIGHT EXPERIENCE; OF WHICH 10 HOURS WAS SIMULATED INSTRUMENT FLIGHT EXPERIENCE.  EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED NO MECHANICAL ANOMALIES.  EXAMINATION OF VOICE COMMUNICATION TAPES REVEALED THAT THE CONTROLLER USED NON-STANDARD APPROACH CLEARANCE PROCEDURES, DID NOT COMPLY WITH REQUIREMENTS FOR WEATHER DISSEMINATION, AND DID NOT COMPLY WITH THE APPROPRIATE INTERCEPT ANGLE OF 45 DEGREES FOR HELICOPTERS AS PRESCRIBED IN FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION ORDERS.","THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AIRCRAFT CONTROL.  FACTORS IN THE ACCIDENT WERE, NIGHT INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, PILOT WORKLOAD, AND IMPROPER AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL PROCEDURES BY THE APPROACH CONTROLLER."

ON MARCH 17, 2006, ABOUT 0935 PACIFIC STANDARD TIME, A KAMAN K-1200 HELICOPTER, N263KA, COLLIDED WITH TERRAIN IN AN UNCONTROLLED DESCENT FOLLOWING A LOSS OF ENGINE POWER WHILE HOVERING OUT OF GROUND EFFECT ABOUT 16 NAUTICAL MILES NORTH OF DAYVILLE, OREGON.  THE COMMERCIAL PILOT, THE SOLE OCCUPANT, RECEIVED FATAL INJURIES, AND THE HELICOPTER SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.  THE HELICOPTER WAS REGISTERED TO AND OPERATED BY GRIZZLY MOUNTAIN AVIATION INC. OF PRINEVILLE, OREGON.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE 14 CFR PART 133 FLIGHT.  THE HELICOPTER WAS BEING USED FOR LONG-LINE LOGGING AND OPERATIONS FOR THE DAY HAD COMMENCED ABOUT 0700.

WITNESSES REPORTED TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES THAT THE PILOT SET DOWN A LOAD OF LOGS AND STATED ON THE RADIO THAT HE WAS GOING TO REPOSITION THE HELICOPTER TO LAND AT THE SERVICE AREA.  AT THIS POINT, THE HELICOPTER WAS ABOUT 300 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL (AGL), HOVERING, WITH THE 200-FOOT LONG LINE STILL ATTACHED.  THE WITNESSES THEN HEARD THE ENGINE ""SHUTDOWN.""  THEY OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER DESCEND VERTICALLY WITH THE ROTORS VISIBLY SLOWING DOWN, NOSE OVER TO AN INVERTED POSITION, IMPACT THE GROUND INVERTED, AND ROLL ONTO ITS LEFT SIDE.  THERE WAS NO FIRE.  

PERSONNEL INFORMATION

THE PILOT HELD A COMMERCIAL PILOT CERTIFICATE WITH A HELICOPTER RATING.  ADDITIONALLY, HE WAS RATED AS A PRIVATE PILOT IN SINGLE ENGINE LAND AIRPLANES.  HIS MOST RECENT MEDICAL CERTIFICATE WAS A SECOND CLASS MEDICAL ISSUED ON APRIL 5, 2005, WITH THE LIMITATION, MUST WEAR CORRECTIVE LENSES.

ACCORDING TO INFORMATION PROVIDED BY GRIZZLY MOUNTAIN AVIATION, THE PILOT HAD ACCUMULATED A TOTAL FLIGHT TIME OF 4,019 HOURS OF WHICH 3,858 HOURS WERE IN HELICOPTERS AND 1,646 HOURS WERE IN THE KAMAN K-1200.  IN THE PREVIOUS 90 DAYS, HE HAD ACCUMULATED 267 HOURS, ALL IN THE KAMAN K-1200.

RECORDS PROVIDED BY KAMAN AEROSPACE CORPORATION INDICATED THAT IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE PILOT SATISFACTORILY COMPLETED THE K-1200 PILOT FAMILIARIZATION TRAINING COURSE AT THE KAMAN FACILITY IN BLOOMFIELD, CONNECTICUT.  THE TRAINING INCLUDED 54 HOURS OF GROUND SCHOOL AND 15 HOURS OF FLIGHT INSTRUCTION.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

THE 2002 MODEL KAMAN K-1200 HELICOPTER, S/N A940033, WAS POWERED BY ONE 1,500-HORSEPOWER HONEYWELL T5317A-1 TURBOSHAFT ENGINE, S/N LE-81003.  AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, THE HELICOPTER HAD ACCUMULATED 3,193.1 HOURS OF FLIGHT TIME, AND THE ENGINE HAD ACCUMULATED 6,636.1 OPERATING HOURS SINCE NEW AND 3,257.4 HOURS SINCE OVERHAUL.
  
REVIEW OF THE ENGINE LOGBOOK REVEALED THAT AN OVERHAULED REDUCTION GEAR BOX, P/N 1-030-350-16, S/N 5E003, WAS INSTALLED ON JANUARY 10, 2005, AT ENGINE TIME SINCE NEW OF 5,813.3 HOURS.  AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, THE REDUCTION GEAR BOX HAD ACCUMULATED 822.8 HOURS SINCE THIS OVERHAUL, WHICH WAS PERFORMED BY A CERTIFIED REPAIR STATION.  REVIEW OF THE WORK ORDER FOR THE REDUCTION GEAR BOX OVERHAUL INDICATED THAT OVERHAULED PLANETARY GEAR SHAFTS WITH SERIAL NUMBERS (S/NS) 16336, 16363, AND 16449 WERE INSTALLED.  

THE LAST MAJOR MAINTENANCE ACTION PERFORMED ON THE ENGINE WAS CONDUCTED ON AUGUST 29, 2005, AT ENGINE TIME SINCE NEW OF 6,285.9 HOURS.  THE LOGBOOK ENTRY FOR THIS MAINTENANCE INDICATED THE ENGINE WAS SENT TO THE SAME REPAIR STATION THAT PERFORMED THE REDUCTION GEAR BOX OVERHAUL FOR ""REPAIR OF REPORTED LOW POWER AND HIGH EGT.""  THE ENTRY STATED, IN PART:  ""INSPECTED HOT SECTION AND COMPRESSOR SECTION, REPLACED AIR DIFFUSER, REPLACED COMBUSTION LINER, REASSEMBLED AND FUNCTIONALLY TESTED I/A/W [IN ACCORDANCE WITH] HONEYWELL 330.2 AND 330.3 MANUALS.""  AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, THE ENGINE HAD ACCUMULATED 350.2 HOURS SINCE THIS REPAIR.

REVIEW OF THE DAILY MAINTENANCE REPORT SHEETS FOR THE HELICOPTER FROM FEBRUARY 15, 2006, TO THE DATE OF THE ACCIDENT REVEALED NO LISTINGS OF ANY UNCORRECTED MAINTENANCE DISCREPANCIES.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

AN ON SCENE EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE WAS CONDUCTED ON MARCH 17, 2006, BY REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE FAA AND KAMAN AEROSPACE CORPORATION.  ACCORDING TO INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE REPRESENTATIVES, THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST INVERTED WITH THE LEFT SIDE OF THE NOSE COMPARTMENT, TOP AND LEFT SIDES OF THE COCKPIT, TOP OF THE TRANSMISSION ROTOR SHAFTS, LEFT SIDE OF THE LANDING GEAR BOOM, AND LEFT STABILIZER CONTACTING THE GROUND.  A CIRCULAR DEBRIS FIELD SURROUNDED THE HELICOPTER WITH THE FARTHEST PIECE OF WRECKAGE LOCATED ABOUT 90 FEET FROM THE HELICOPTER.  THE CARGO HOOK ON THE HELICOPTER'S BELLY WAS OPEN WITH THE CORRESPONDING END OF THE LONG LINE SEVERAL FEET AWAY.  THE LONG LINE WAS LAID OUT ON THE GROUND AFT OF THE HELICOPTER.  THE LINE WAS INTACT, AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF THE LINE BECOMING ENTANGLED DURING THE ACCIDENT SEQUENCE.

THE FUSELAGE REMAINED INTACT, BUT WAS CRUSHED, DISTORTED AND BROKEN AFT OF THE LANDING GEAR BOOM.  THE TAIL BOOM REMAINED ATTACHED AND WAS DISTORTED.  THE TOP 18 INCHES OF THE VERTICAL FIN WERE BROKEN OFF, AND THE RUDDER WAS SEPARATED FROM THE VERTICAL FIN.  THE SEPARATED SECTION OF THE VERTICAL FIN AND THE RUDDER WERE FOUND WITHIN THE DEBRIS FIELD.  ALL FOUR MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE BROKEN INTO SECTIONS;  ALL OF THE SECTIONS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE DEBRIS FIELD.  ACCORDING TO THE KAMAN REPRESENTATIVE, ""THE ROTOR BLADE SECTIONS WERE IN RELATIVELY LARGE PIECES DENOTING A SLOW ROTOR SPEED AT IMPACT.""  DURING EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER AT THE ACCIDENT SITE, 80 GALLONS OF FUEL WERE DRAINED FROM THE HELICOPTER'S FUEL SYSTEM, AND THE FUEL FILTER AND FUEL SAMPLES APPEARED TO BE CLEAN.    

THE WRECKAGE WAS RECOVERED FROM THE ACCIDENT SITE AND TRANSPORTED TO SPECIALTY AIRCRAFT IN REDMOND, OREGON, WHERE IT WAS FURTHER EXAMINED BY THE FAA AND KAMAN REPRESENTATIVES ON MARCH 20, 2006.  THE TRANSMISSION, ROTOR SHAFTS AND HUBS REMAINED TOGETHER AS A SINGLE UNIT, BUT THE UNIT SUSTAINED HEAVY IMPACT DAMAGE.  THE ENGINE-TO-TRANSMISSION DRIVE SHAFT WAS SEPARATED INTO 3 SECTIONS.  THE FRACTURE SURFACES ON THE DRIVE SHAFT SHOWED NO SIGNS OF FATIGUE.  INSPECTION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED THAT THE POWER TURBINE COULD BE ROTATED BY MANUALLY TURNING THE SECOND STAGE POWER TURBINE WHEEL.  WHEN THE POWER TURBINE WAS ROTATED, THE ENGINE OUTPUT ADAPTER ATTACHED TO THE REDUCTION GEARBOX DID NOT ROTATE, INDICATING A MECHANICAL DISCONNECT WITHIN THE ENGINE.  THE ENGINE WAS REMOVED FROM THE HELICOPTER AND SENT TO THE FACILITIES OF HONEYWELL IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION.

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

AN AUTOPSY OF THE PILOT WAS CONDUCTED BY THE MEDICAL EXAMINER DIVISION OF THE OREGON STATE POLICE IN CLACKAMAS, OREGON.  TOXICOLOGY TESTS CONDUCTED BY THE FAA'S TOXICOLOGY AND ACCIDENT RESEARCH LABORATORY WERE NEGATIVE FOR CARBON MONOXIDE, CYANIDE, ETHANOL AND DRUGS.

TESTS AND RESEARCH

THE ENGINE WAS EXAMINED AT THE HONEYWELL FACILITIES IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA ON MAY 1 AND 2, 2006, UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE NTSB INVESTIGATOR-IN-CHARGE (IIC).  DISASSEMBLY OF THE ENGINE REVEALED SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE SUN GEAR SHAFT (P/N 1-130-192-04, S/N 71037), WHICH COUPLED THE POWER TURBINE TO THE REDUCTION GEAR BOX.  SPECIFICALLY, THE CENTER SECTION OF THE SUN GEAR ON THE FORWARD END OF THE SHAFT WAS COMPLETELY MILLED AWAY, WELL INTO THE GEAR SHAFT RIM.  THE THREE PLANETARY GEAR SHAFTS (P/N 1-030-193-01, S/NS 16336, 16363, AND 16449) DISPLAYED DAMAGED AND MISSING TEETH ON THEIR AFT GEARS, WHICH MATED WITH THE SUN GEAR.  THERE WAS METAL DEBRIS ADHERING TO ALL OF THE GEAR SHAFTS.  A LARGE AMOUNT OF METAL DEBRIS, INCLUDING PIECES THAT APPEARED TO BE FRAGMENTS OF GEAR TEETH, WAS FOUND IN THE INLET HOUSING, WHICH COVERS THE REDUCTION GEAR BOX.

EACH PLANETARY GEAR SHAFT WAS SUPPORTED AT ITS AFT END BY A ROLLER BEARING, THE OUTER RACE OF WHICH WAS PRESSED INTO A BORE IN THE AFT PLATE OF THE PLANETARY GEAR CARRIER ASSEMBLY.  THE AFT ROLLER BEARING THAT SUPPORTED PLANETARY GEAR SHAFT S/N 16336 WAS FOUND MISSING ITS CAGE, AND THE INDIVIDUAL ROLLERS WERE CLUSTERED TOGETHER, SUCH THAT A GAP WITHOUT ROLLERS EXTENDED APPROXIMATELY 90 DEGREES AROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE BEARING.  PIECES OF THE MISSING CAGE WERE LOCATED AMONG THE DEBRIS IN THE INLET HOUSING.

THE LOCKCUP FOR THE N1 SEAL AND NUT ASSEMBLY, LOCATED ON THE FORWARD END OF THE N1 COMPRESSOR TURBINE SHAFT, WAS FOUND DISENGAGED, AND THE NUT ASSEMBLY HAD BACKED OFF OF THE THREADS ON THE COMPRESSOR SHAFT.  THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF HEAVY ROTATIONAL CONTACT BETWEEN THE FORWARD SIDE OF THE NUT ASSEMBLY AND THE AFT FACE OF THE #21 ROLLER BEARING.  THE #21 ROLLER BEARING, WHICH SUPPORTS THE N2 POWER TURBINE SHAFT, WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED.  SPECIFICALLY, THE ROLLERS WERE WORN TO A SHAPE THAT LOCKED THEM IN THEIR CAGE, WHICH PREVENTED THEM FROM ROTATING.  THE DAMAGED BEARING HAD ALLOWED THE N2 POWER TURBINE SHAFT TO CONTACT AND RUB THE INSIDE OF THE N1 COMPRESSOR TURBINE SHAFT.  (THE N1 SHAFT IS HOLLOW, AND THE N2 SHAFT IS HOUSED WITHIN IT.)

AT THE REQUEST OF THE NTSB IIC, HONEYWELL PERFORMED MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING ANALYSIS ON MULTIPLE COMPONENTS FROM THE ENGINE.  THESE COMPONENTS INCLUDED THE SUN GEAR SHAFT, THE THREE PLANETARY GEAR SHAFTS, THEIR BEARINGS, THE PLANETARY GEAR CARRIER ASSEMBLY, THE N1 SEAL AND NUT ASSEMBLY, ITS LOCKCUP, AND THE #21 ROLLER BEARING.  THE FINDINGS OF THE MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING ANALYSIS WERE, IN PART:
1.  THE AFT SHOULDER OF THE OUTER RACE ON THE AFT ROLLER BEARING THAT SUPPORTED PLANETARY GEAR SHAFT S/N 16336 EXHIBITED FOUR HALF MOON SHAPED INDENTATIONS, CONSISTENT WITH THE SPACING OF FOUR ADJACENT ROLLERS INSTALLED IN THE BEARING CAGE.  THE INDENTATIONS WERE INDICATIVE OF ALIGNMENT-RELATED ASSEMBLY DAMAGE.
2.  EXAMINATION OF THE CORRESPONDING BORE IN THE AFT PLATE OF THE PLANETARY GEAR CARRIER ASSEMBLY REVEALED A SERIES OF AXIAL DRAG MARKS FROM A RELUCTANT ASSEMBLY OF THE AFT ROLLER BEARING INTO THE BORE.  THESE AXIAL MARKS WERE OVERLAID BY CIRCUMFERENTIAL MARKS DUE TO ROTATION OF THE BEARING WITHIN THE BORE DURING OPERATION, INDICATING THAT THE AXIAL MARKS WERE MADE DURING INSTALLATION, NOT DURING DISASSEMBLY.  
3.  PLANETARY GEAR SHAFT S/N 16336 EXHIBITED FATIGUE SEPARATIONS ON SEVERAL OF THE AFT GEAR TEETH THAT MATED WITH THE SUN GEAR.  THE CASE DEPTH, CASE HARDNESS, AND CORE HARDNESS OF THE PLANETARY GEAR TEETH WERE AS SPECIFIED.
4.  EXAMINATION OF THE LOCKCUP FOR THE N1 SEAL AND NUT ASSEMBLY REVEALED EVIDENCE THAT THE LOCKCUP WAS NOT PROPERLY ENGAGED INTO THE NUT ASSEMBLY.  SPECIFICALLY, FIVE OF THE AVAILABLE SIX AREAS ON THE LOCKCUP WERE CRIMPED; HOWEVER, THE CRIMPS WERE ALL NOTABLY SHALLOW.

ON THE BASIS OF THE MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING ANALYSIS, HONEYWELL DEVELOPED THE FOLLOWING CHAIN OF EVENTS LEADING TO EXCESSIVE WEAR OF THE SUN GEAR SHAFT:
1.  THE AFT ROLLER BEARING THAT SUPPORTED PLANETARY GEAR SHAFT S/N 16336 WAS IMPROPERLY ASSEMBLED, RESULTING IN DAMAGE TO THE BEARING.  
2.  OPERATION OF THE AFT BEARING WITH THE SHOULDER DAMAGE AT A SPACING IDENTICAL TO FOUR ADJACENT ROLLER POCKETS RESULTED IN THE ROLLERS POUNDING THE CAGE POCKETS, EVENTUALLY FATIGUING AND BREAKING THE CAGE CROSS-WEBS.  AFTER THE CROSS-WEBS ALL SEPARATED FROM THE CAGE RINGS, THE ROLLERS ALL CLUSTERED TOGETHER, RESULTING IN AN APPROXIMATELY 90 DEGREE GAP WITHOUT ROLLERS.  
3.  THE GAP WITHOUT ROLLERS INDUCED A PERIODIC HIGH MISALIGNMENT IN PLANETARY GEAR SHAFT S/N 16336 EACH TIME THE GAP PASSED THROUGH THE LOAD ZONE.  THIS ACTION LED TO FATIGUE FAILURES TO THE TEETH OF THE PLANETARY GEAR AND AN INCREASE IN VIBRATION.
4.  ENGINE VIBRATION FROM THE FAILING PLANETARY GEAR TRAIN ALONG WITH THE IMPROPERLY CRIMPED N1 SEAL AND NUT ASSEMBLY LOCKCUP LOOSENED THE NUT.  THE NUT THEN BACKED OFF AND JAMMED INTO THE #21 BEARING.
5.  CONTACT BETWEEN THE N1 SEAL AND NUT ASSEMBLY AND THE #21 BEARING LED TO SLIDING OF THE BEARING'S ROLLERS RESULTING IN EXCESSIVE WEAR TO THE ROLLERS.  RADIAL WEAR CONTINUED IN THE BEARING, EVENTUALLY ALLOWING THE N2 SHAFT TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE INSIDE OF THE N1 SHAFT.
6.  RUBBING OF THE SHAFTS PRODUCED FURTHER MISALIGNMENT IN THE PLANETARY GEAR TRAIN LEADING TO HIGH TOOTH LOADING IN THE SUN GEAR SHAFT, WHICH RESULTED IN STRIPPING AND SEPARATION OF GEAR TEETH AND LOSS OF TRANSMITTED TORQUE THROUGH THE REDUCTION GEAR CARRIER ASSEMBLY.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

THE WRECKAGE WAS RELEASED TO A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OWNER ON DECEMBER 6, 2006.","THE HELICOPTER EXPERIENCED A TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER WHILE HOVERING OUT OF GROUND EFFECT DURING A LONG-LINE LOGGING OPERATION.  WITNESSES OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER DESCEND VERTICALLY WITH THE ROTORS VISIBLY SLOWING DOWN, NOSE OVER TO AN INVERTED POSITION, IMPACT THE GROUND INVERTED, AND ROLL ONTO ITS LEFT SIDE.   INITIAL EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED THAT WHEN THE POWER TURBINE WAS ROTATED, THE ENGINE OUTPUT ADAPTER ATTACHED TO THE REDUCTION GEARBOX DID NOT ROTATE, INDICATING A MECHANICAL DISCONNECT WITHIN THE ENGINE.  DISASSEMBLY OF THE ENGINE REVEALED SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE SUN GEAR SHAFT, WHICH COUPLED THE POWER TURBINE TO THE REDUCTION GEAR BOX.  FURTHER DISASSEMBLY AND MATERIALS ANALYSIS DISCLOSED AN ASSEMBLY ERROR OF ONE OF THE THREE AFT PLANETARY GEAR SHAFT ROLLER BEARINGS IN THE REDUCTION GEAR BOX AND IMPROPER CRIMPING OF THE LOCKCUP ON THE N1 SEAL AND NUT ASSEMBLY.  THESE TWO ERRORS RESULTED IN MISALIGNMENT IN THE PLANETARY GEAR TRAIN LEADING TO HIGH TOOTH LOADING IN THE SUN GEAR SHAFT, WHICH RESULTED IN STRIPPING AND SEPARATION OF GEAR TEETH AND LOSS OF TRANSMITTED TORQUE THROUGH THE REDUCTION GEAR BOX.  EXAMINATION OF MAINTENANCE RECORDS INDICATED THAT THE BEARING ASSEMBLY ERROR OCCURRED DURING AN OVERHAUL OF THE REDUCTION GEAR BOX BY A CERTIFIED REPAIR STATION 822.8 OPERATING HOURS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. THE IMPROPER CRIMPING OF THE LOCKCUP OCCURRED DURING A REPAIR BY THE SAME CERTIFIED REPAIR STATION PERFORMED 350.2 OPERATING HOURS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.","THE IMPROPER OVERHAUL OF THE REDUCTION GEAR BOX ASSEMBLY AND IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF THE N1 SEAL AND NUT ASSEMBLY LOCKCUP BY MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL, WHICH RESULTED IN FAILURE OF THE REDUCTION GEAR BOX AND A TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER.  A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WAS THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE ROTOR RPM FOLLOWING THE POWER LOSS, WHICH RESULTED IN AN UNCONTROLLED DESCENT TO GROUND IMPACT."

ON MAY 30, 2006, AT 1645 EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME, A EUROCOPTER EC-135P1, N601FH, OPERATED BY CJ SYSTEMS, INC., WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED WHEN IT COLLIDED WITH TERRAIN WHILE MANEUVERING TO LAND AT THE WASHINGTON HOSPITAL CENTER HELIPAD (DC08), WASHINGTON, D.C.  THE CERTIFICATED AIRLINE TRANSPORT PILOT AND TWO MEDICAL CREWMEMBERS WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED.  THE CRITICALLY ILL PATIENT ON BOARD THE HELICOPTER WAS FATALLY INJURED.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED FOR THE FLIGHT THAT ORIGINATED AT GREATER SOUTHEAST COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, WASHINGTON, D.C.  A COMPANY FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE MEDICAL TRANSPORT FLIGHT CONDUCTED UNDER 14 CFR PART 135.

THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST ON THE GOLF COURSE AT THE ARMED FORCES RETIREMENT HOME, APPROXIMATELY 1/2 MILE NORTH OF THE HELIPAD.  THE ELEVATION AT BOTH THE CRASH SITE AND THE HOSPITAL HELIPAD WAS APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET ABOVE MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL).

A REVIEW OF RADAR DATA REVEALED THAT A TARGET IDENTIFIED AS THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER APPROACHED THE HELIPAD FROM THE SOUTH, AND OVERFLEW THE HELIPAD.  THE HELICOPTER THEN COMPLETED A TEARDROP-SHAPED CIRCUIT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOSPITAL CENTER, RETURNED, AND AGAIN OVER FLEW THE HELIPAD, TRAVELING SOUTHBOUND.  AFTER CROSSING THE HELIPAD, A LEFT-HAND CIRCUIT THAT ROUGHLY RESEMBLED A STANDARD AIRPORT TRAFFIC PATTERN WAS FLOWN AROUND THE EAST SIDE OF THE HOSPITAL GROUNDS.  THE HELICOPTER TURNED WESTBOUND IN WHAT APPROXIMATED A BASE-LEG TURN, THEN THE RADAR TARGET WAS LOST IN THE AREA OF THE CRASH SITE.  THE ALTITUDES RECORDED FROM THE FIRST OVER FLIGHT OF THE HELIPAD TO THE LAST RADAR TARGET WERE BETWEEN 200 AND 300 FEET MSL.

THE PILOT WAS ABLE TO RECALL PORTIONS OF THE FLIGHT, AND RECOUNTED THEM DURING AN INTERVIEW WITH SAFETY BOARD INVESTIGATORS.  ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, HE RECEIVED THE FLIGHT REQUEST, CHECKED THE WEATHER, AND PERFORMED A PREFLIGHT INSPECTION.  HE THEN PERFORMED A WALK-AROUND INSPECTION WITH HIS CREW PRIOR TO TAKEOFF.  THE PICKUP OF THE PATIENT AND THE FLIGHT TO WASHINGTON HOSPITAL CENTER WERE ROUTINE.

THE PILOT REPORTED THAT AS THE HELICOPTER APPROACHED THE HELIPAD, IT ""SHUFFLED"" AND THE NO. 1 ENGINE RPM INCREASED.  THE PILOT INCREASED COLLECTIVE PITCH, AND REDUCED THE THROTTLE ON THE NO. 1 ENGINE TO CONTROL ENGINE AND ROTOR RPM, THEN ABORTED THE LANDING.  HE WAS ABLE TO CONTROL THE RPM, AND DID NOT RECALL ANY VISUAL OR AURAL WARNINGS REGARDING RPM LIMITS.  HE STATED THAT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FLIGHT, THE NO. 1 ENGINE WAS OPERATED IN MANUAL MODE, AND THE NO. 2 ENGINE REMAINED IN AUTOMATIC MODE.

AS THE PILOT MANEUVERED THE HELICOPTER OVER THE GOLF COURSE, THE ""SHUFFLE"" WORSENED, AND THE HELICOPTER BECAME UNCONTROLLABLE.  HE REMEMBERED A BUILDING AND A TREE WERE IN THE HELICOPTER'S FLIGHT PATH AS IT DESCENDED.  HE MANEUVERED TOWARD THE TREE, TRANSMITTED A ""MAYDAY"" CALL, AND ALERTED HIS CREW PRIOR TO IMPACT.

IN AN INTERVIEW, THE FLIGHT MEDIC STATED THAT AS THE HELICOPTER TERMINATED THE FIRST APPROACH, HE HEARD AN AUDIO ALARM IN HIS HEADSET, AND ""IT FELT LIKE THE HELICOPTER LOST POWER.""  THE HELICOPTER CIRCLED FOR A SECOND ATTEMPT, AND AS THEY APPROACHED THE HELIPAD, THE MEDIC AGAIN HEARD THE AUDIO ALARM IN HIS HEADSET, AND THE LANDING WAS AGAIN ABORTED.

THE PILOT ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS ""LOSING POWER,"" AND COULDN'T SLOW THE HELICOPTER.  AS THE HELICOPTER FLEW AROUND THE HOSPITAL CENTER, THE PILOT ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD RETURN AND ATTEMPT TO LAND AT THE LOWER HELIPAD.

ONCE OVER THE GOLF COURSE, THE HELICOPTER BEGAN TO VIBRATE.  THE VIBRATION INCREASED, THE NOSE YAWED FROM SIDE TO SIDE, AND THE HELICOPTER ""WENT INTO A SPIN.""  IT DESCENDED VERTICALLY, STRUCK A TREE, THEN TERRAIN, AND ROLLED OVER ON ITS SIDE.

THE MEDIC REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES THAT IT ""FELT"" AND ""SOUNDED LIKE"" THE HELICOPTER WAS LOSING POWER.  HE ADDED, ""AS LONG AS HE WASN'T TRYING TO LAND, HE COULD KEEP FLYING.  HE COULDN'T SLOW IT DOWN, BUT WE COULD HAVE STAYED UP AND [CONTINUED TO FLY].""

THE FLIGHT NURSE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE FLIGHT WAS SIMILAR TO THE MEDIC'S, AND SHE REMEMBERED TWO OVER FLIGHTS OF THE UPPER HELIPAD, AND THE PILOT STATING THAT THEY WOULD ATTEMPT A LANDING AT THE LOWER HELIPAD.  SHE DID NOT RECALL HEARING AN AUDIO ALARM IN HER HEADSET, NOR DID SHE RECALL THE PILOT ANNOUNCING A LOSS OF POWER.  AS THE HELICOPTER APPROACHED THE GOLF COURSE, ""IT SLOWED, ROCKED, AND STARTED SHAKING.""  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE SOUND OF THE ENGINES, SHE SAID, ""THERE WAS A LOT OF SPUTTERING.  THEY DIDN'T SOUND LIKE THEY WERE GOING FAST LIKE THEY USUALLY DID.  THERE WAS THAT SPUTTERING NOISE, THEN A METALLIC BANGING.""

BOTH THE FLIGHT NURSE AND THE MEDIC STATED THAT THEY COULD NOT VIEW THE INSTRUMENTS NOR COULD THEY SEE THE PILOT MANIPULATE THE FLIGHT CONTROLS.

IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW, A WITNESS STATED THAT HE HEARD THE HELICOPTER ""SPUTTER"" AS IT APPROACHED, AND THEN THE SOUNDS OF IMPACT, BUT HE DID NOT SEE THE ACCIDENT.

A SECOND WITNESS SAID SHE WATCHED THE HELICOPTER OVER FLY THE GOLF COURSE AT LOW ALTITUDE, ""UP AND DOWN, KIND OF OUT OF CONTROL.  IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN ALTITUDE.""  THE HELICOPTER FLEW OUT OF VIEW TOWARD THE HOSPITAL, AND SEVERAL MINUTES LATER, IT RETURNED OVER THE GOLF COURSE, AND THE SOUNDS OF IMPACT WERE HEARD.

PERSONNEL INFORMATION

THE PILOT HELD AN AIRLINE TRANSPORT PILOT CERTIFICATE WITH A RATING FOR AIRPLANE MULTI-ENGINE LAND, AND ROTORCRAFT HELICOPTER.  HIS MOST RECENT FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) SECOND-CLASS MEDICAL CERTIFICATE WAS ISSUED ON NOVEMBER 8, 2005.  A REVIEW OF COMPANY TRAINING RECORDS REVEALED THAT THE PILOT HAD ACCUMULATED 15,613 TOTAL HOURS OF FLIGHT EXPERIENCE, 12,413 HOURS OF WHICH WERE IN HELICOPTERS, AND 914 HOURS OF WHICH WERE IN MAKE AND MODEL.  HIS MOST RECENT FAR PART 135 COMPETENCY CHECK WAS COMPLETED DECEMBER 22, 2005, IN THE EC-135T1 HELICOPTER, WHICH WAS EQUIPPED WITH DIFFERENT ENGINES AND A DIFFERENT COCKPIT DISPLAY THAN THE EC-135P1 ACCIDENT HELICOPTER.

WHEN QUESTIONED IN A FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEW WITH THE SAFETY BOARD ABOUT HIS TRAINING IN THE EC-135 HELICOPTER, THE PILOT SAID THAT ALL OF HIS TRAINING WAS CONDUCTED IN TURBOMECA ENGINE-EQUIPPED HELICOPTERS, AND THAT HE RECEIVED NO FORMAL TRAINING IN THE EC-135P1 COCKPIT DISPLAY SYSTEM (CDS) PRATT AND WHITNEY ENGINE-EQUIPPED ACCIDENT HELICOPTER.

EXAMINATION OF THE ACCIDENT PILOT'S TRAINING RECORDS REVEALED THAT ON DECEMBER 27, 2005, HE RECEIVED 1 HOUR OF ""DIFFERENCES TRAINING"" IN N601FH.  DURING THAT SINGLE HOUR OF TRAINING, THE PILOT COMPLETED 30 MINUTES OF ""INSTRUMENT"" FLIGHT THAT INCLUDED TWO INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM APPROACHES.  THE PILOT DID NOT SPECIFICALLY RECALL THE FLIGHT, BUT WAS SURPRISED AT THE NOTES BECAUSE ""N601FH WAS A VFR-ONLY AIRCRAFT.""

THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE RECEIVED CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION ON THE -P1 CDS MODEL, BUT STATED THAT HE HAD ""NEVER"" SEEN AN EC-135P1 CDS TRAINING MANUAL.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

A REVIEW OF THE FLIGHT MANUAL AND MAINTENANCE RECORDS REVEALED THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WAS MAINTAINED ACCORDING TO A MANUFACTURER'S INSPECTION PROGRAM, AND THE MOST RECENT 50-HOUR INSPECTION WAS COMPLETED MAY 19, 2006, AT 2,977 AIRCRAFT HOURS.  THE HELICOPTER HAD ACCRUED 2,995 TOTAL FLIGHT HOURS AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.  THE HELICOPTER WAS NOT EQUIPPED OR CERTIFIED FOR IFR FLIGHT.

THE ENGINES WERE EQUIPPED WITH FULL AUTHORITY DIGITAL ENGINE CONTROLS (FADECS).

THE THROTTLES WERE MOUNTED ON THE COLLECTIVE.  THE FORWARD THROTTLE WAS FOR THE NO. 1 (LEFT) ENGINE, AND THE AFT THROTTLE WAS FOR THE NO. 2 (RIGHT) ENGINE.  FOR THE THROTTLES TO BE IN THE NEUTRAL POSITION, A WHITE LINE AND THE LETTER ""N"" ON EACH THROTTLE HAD TO BE ALIGNED WITH A WHITE ARROW ON THE COLLECTIVE.  THERE WAS A NOTICEABLE DETENT WHEN THE THROTTLE WAS ROLLED ACROSS THE NEUTRAL POSITION, WHICH MATCHED THE PAINTED POSITIONS THAT WERE MID-WAY BETWEEN THE FULL OPEN AND MINIMUM IDLE POSITIONS.  NORMAL FLIGHT WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE THROTTLES IN THE NEUTRAL POSITION, ALLOWING THE FADECS TO CONTROL THE ENGINES.  THE FADECS PROVIDED SEVERAL FUNCTIONS, WHICH INCLUDED THE SCHEDULING OF FUEL AND MAINTAINING ENGINE OPERATION WITHIN PREDETERMINED LIMITS.

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

AT 1652, THE WEATHER RECORDED AT THE RONALD REAGAN/WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT, 5 MILES SOUTH OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, INCLUDED A BROKEN CEILING AT 6,000 FEET AND 8,500 FEET WITH 7 MILES VISIBILITY.  THE WIND WAS FROM 120 DEGREES AT 9 KNOTS.  THE TEMPERATURE WAS 89 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, AND THE DEWPOINT WAS 68 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.  THE ALTIMETER SETTING WAS 30.03 INCHES OF MERCURY.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER WAS EXAMINED ON MAY 30, 2006, AND ALL MAJOR COMPONENTS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE SCENE.  PRIOR TO EXAMINATION, EMERGENCY PERSONNEL AND PILOTS WHO RESPONDED TO THE SCENE MANIPULATED FLIGHT CONTROLS, SWITCHES, AND COMPONENTS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FIRE.

THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST NEXT TO A TREE THAT EXHIBITED DEEP CUTS AND SLASH MARKS ALONG ITS TRUNK FROM GROUND LEVEL TO ABOUT 20 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.  SEVERAL BRANCHES WERE BROKEN, AND SEVERAL DISPLAYED CLEAN, ANGULAR CUTS.  PIECES OF CUT AND BROKEN BRANCHES WERE SCATTERED AROUND THE WRECKAGE.

THE FUSELAGE RESTED ON ITS LEFT SIDE, AND THE COCKPIT AND CABIN AREAS WERE LARGELY INTACT.  THE PILOT'S WINDSCREEN AND CHIN BUBBLE WERE BROKEN.  THE TAILBOOM WAS ATTACHED, BUT TWISTED 90 DEGREES AND RESTED UPRIGHT.  THE TAILROTOR DRIVESHAFT AND CONTROL CABLES WERE BROKEN AT THE TAILBOOM ATTACH POINT.  THE CABLES AND THE DRIVESHAFT DISPLAYED FRACTURES CONSISTENT WITH OVERLOAD.  THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER, VERTICAL FIN, AND FENESTRON WERE ALL INTACT.

EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER REVEALED THE NO. 1 ENGINE THROTTLE (FORWARD) IN THE NEUTRAL POSITION.  THE NO. 2 ENGINE THROTTLE (REAR) WAS FOUND DISPLACED FROM THE NEUTRAL POSITION TOWARDS THE IDLE CUT-OFF POSITION.

ALL FOUR MAIN ROTOR BLADES DISPLAYED SPANWISE FRACTURES AT THE ROOT, ABOUT 1 FOOT OUTBOARD OF THEIR RESPECTIVE HUBS, BUT REMAINED ATTACHED.  THE BLADES WERE FRACTURED, BENT, AND TORN ALONG THEIR SPANS, WITH THE TIPS DISINTEGRATED ON ALL BUT THE YELLOW BLADE.  BLADE TIP FRAGMENTS, TIP WEIGHTS, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED PLASTIC SPACERS WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE CRASH SITE.

EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE RESUMED JUNE 1, 2006, AT TIPTON AIRFIELD, FT. MEADE, MARYLAND.  CONTROL CONTINUITY WAS ESTABLISHED FROM THE CYCLIC AND COLLECTIVE CONTROLS TO THE ROTOR HEAD.  TAIL ROTOR CONTROL CONTINUITY WAS ESTABLISHED FROM THE ANTI-TORQUE PEDALS TO THE CABLE BREAKS IN THE TAILBOOM, AND THEN FROM THE BREAKS TO THE FENESTRON.

THE MAIN TRANSMISSION WAS INTACT AND SECURE IN ITS MOUNTS.  CONTINUITY WAS ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE TRANSMISSION TO ALL OF ITS ACCESSORIES.  THE MAGNETIC CHIP DETECTORS WERE ABSENT OF DEBRIS.

THE NO. 1 AND NO. 2 FLIGHT CONTROL HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS WERE TESTED INDIVIDUALLY.  EACH SYSTEM WAS PRESSURIZED BY MOTORING ITS RESPECTIVE HYDRAULIC PUMP.  BOTH LATERAL SERVOS AND COLLECTIVE SERVO WERE ACTUATED THROUGH THEIR FULL RANGES WITH NO ANOMALIES NOTED.  THE ACTUATORS WERE MOVED INDIVIDUALLY, AND THEN ALL THREE WERE MOVED SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGH THEIR FULL RANGES WITH NO ANOMALIES NOTED.  THERE WAS CORRESPONDING MOVEMENT IN THE COLLECTIVE AND CYCLIC CONTROLS TO THE ROTOR HUB.  IN ADDITION, THE HYDRAULIC FILTERS WERE REMOVED, AND THE FILTERS, ALONG WITH THE HOUSINGS, WERE ABSENT OF DEBRIS.

THE ENGINES APPEARED INTACT AND UNDAMAGED.  THEY WERE REMOVED, AND SHIPPED TO PRATT AND WHITNEY CANADA FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION, ALONG WITH THE FADEC UNITS. 

TESTS AND RESEARCH

THE ENGINES WERE REEXAMINED AT THE PRATT AND WHITNEY ENGINE FACTORY, LONGUILLE, CANADA, ON JULY 12, 2006.  DOWNLOAD AND INTERROGATION OF THE ENGINE FADECS REVEALED NO ANOMALIES AFFECTING NORMAL OPERATION.  THE FAULTS RECORDED WERE CHARACTERISTIC OF ENGINE SUDDEN STOPPAGE WITH THE ENGINES PRODUCING POWER AT THE TIME OF IMPACT.  EXAMINATION OF THE DATA REVEALED THAT THE NO. 1 ENGINE WAS AT 76 PERCENT NG AT IMPACT, CONSISTENT WITH A GROUND IDLE POWER SETTING.  THE NO. 2 ENGINE WAS AT 53 PERCENT NG, WHICH WAS BELOW GROUND IDLE.

THE ENGINES WERE EACH PLACED IN A TEST CELL, AND MANUAL STARTS WERE PERFORMED ON EACH.  BOTH ENGINES STARTED IMMEDIATELY, AND RAN CONTINUOUSLY WITHOUT INTERRUPTION AT ALL POWER SETTINGS USING THE MATCHED FADECS FROM THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER, WITH NO FAULTS NOTED.

EACH ENGINE WAS THEN RUN THROUGH AN ENTIRE FUNCTIONAL TEST SEQUENCE USING THE AUTO-START FEATURE.  EACH ENGINE STARTED IMMEDIATELY AND RAN CONTINUOUSLY WITHOUT INTERRUPTION WITH NO FAULTS NOTED.

COCKPIT DISPLAY SYSTEM

THE CDS WAS EXAMINED AT THE HONEYWELL/GRIMES FACILITY, UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE FAA.  ACCORDING TO HONEYWELL/GRIMES, THE NON-VOLATILE MEMORY RECORDED THE DATA DISPLAYED DURING THE LAST MINUTE OF FLIGHT.  ACCORDING TO THE EC-135 FLIGHT MANUAL, WARNING LIGHTS WERE DISPLAYED IN ORDER OF ILLUMINATION UNTIL THEY WERE ACKNOWLEDGED, AT WHICH POINT THEY FELL INTO A PREDETERMINED PRIORITY ORDER:

FOR THE NO. 1 ENGINE, THE TOP LIGHT ILLUMINATED WAS ENG MANUAL, FOLLOWED BY HYD PRESS, BUSTIE OPN, ENG OIL P, FADEC FAIL AND TWIST GRIP.

FOR THE NO. 2 ENGINE, THE TOP LIGHT ILLUMINATED WAS ENG MANUAL, FOLLOWED BY TWIST GRIP, HYD PRESS, ENG OIL P, AND FADEC FAIL. 

FADEC FAIL INDICATED A LOSS OF AUTOMATIC ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION CONTROL ON THE ENGINE.  ENG OIL P INDICATED A LOSS OF ENGINE OIL PRESSURE.  BUSTIE OPN INDICATED THAT THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS WERE SEPARATED AND THE HIGH LOAD BUS WAS DISCONNECTED.  FUEL PRESS INDICATED A LOSS OF ENGINE FUEL PRESSURE, AND HYD PRESS INDICATED A LOSS OF HYDRAULIC PRESSURE. 

ENGINE MANUAL AND TWIST GRIP ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL UNDER ""MANUAL ENGINE CONTROL"" IN THE ""ADDITIONAL INFORMATION"" SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

THE HELICOPTER WAS REEXAMINED IN CLAYTON, DELAWARE, ON JULY 20, 2006.  EXAMINATION OF THE TWIST-GRIP THROTTLES CONFIRMED CONTROL CONTINUITY FROM EACH THROTTLE TO THE ENGINE DECK.

THE NO. 1 ENGINE TWIST GRIP COULD NOT BE ROTATED DUE TO IMPACT-DAMAGED INTERFERENCE WITH ITS ASSOCIATED CABLE AND LINKAGES, SO THE NO. 2 ENGINE TWIST GRIP WAS TESTED FIRST.  THE NO. 2 ENGINE TWIST GRIP CABLES AND LINKAGES WERE FREE FROM IMPACT DAMAGE INTERFERENCE AND NO MODIFICATION WAS NEEDED TO TEST THE SYSTEM.  BREAKAWAY FORCE WAS MEASURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AIRFRAME MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR EC-135 HELICOPTERS EQUIPPED WITH PRATT AND WHITNEY ENGINES.  THE TARGET VALUE RANGE WAS BETWEEN 11.24 AND 18 LBS.  WHEN MEASURED, 13.5 LBS. OF BREAKAWAY FORCE WAS REQUIRED TO ROTATE THE THROTTLE TO THE DECREASE SIDE, AND 17 LBS. OF BREAKAWAY FORCE WAS REQUIRED TO THE INCREASE SIDE.  THE PROCESS WAS REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES AND PRODUCED THE SAME RESULTS.

THE NO. 1 ENGINE TWIST GRIP CABLING AND LINKAGES COULD NOT BE FREED, SO THE THROTTLE CABLE WAS CUT, IN ORDER TO DETERMINE A BREAKAWAY VALUE ON THE TWIST GRIP.  THE MEASURED BREAKAWAY FORCE ON THE NO. 1 ENGINE TWIST GRIP WAS 6.5 LBS. ON THE DECREASE SIDE, AND 5 LBS. ON THE INCREASE SIDE, WITH A DISCERNABLE NEUTRAL DETENT.

TO OBTAIN A COMPARISON VALUE BETWEEN THE TWO TWIST GRIPS, THE BREAKAWAY FORCE CHECK ON THE NO. 2 TWIST GRIP WAS ALSO PERFORMED WITH THE MECHANICAL LINKAGE DISCONNECTED.  IT MEASURED 4.5 LBS. OF BREAKAWAY FORCE TO THE DECREASE SIDE, AND 4 LBS. BREAKAWAY FORCE TO THE INCREASE SIDE, WITH A DISCERNABLE NEUTRAL DETENT.

PERFORMANCE PLANNING

ACCORDING TO WEIGHT AND BALANCE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE OPERATOR, THE HELICOPTER WEIGHED 5,776 LBS. AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.

INTERPOLATION OF PERFORMANCE CHARTS REVEALED, GIVEN THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS, THE DUAL-ENGINE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE GROSS WEIGHT FOR THE HELICOPTER TO HOVER BOTH IN AND OUT OF GROUND EFFECT, WAS 5,996 LBS.

THE SINGLE-ENGINE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE GROSS WEIGHT TO HOVER IN GROUND EFFECT WAS 5,269 POUNDS, AND TO HOVER OUT OF GROUND EFFECT WAS 4,828 LBS.

AT 5,776 LBS., THE MINIMUM SINGLE-ENGINE APPROACH AIRSPEED WAS 65 KNOTS, AND THE MINIMUM AIRSPEED ON APPROACH AT 50 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL FOR A RUN-ON LANDING WAS 40 KNOTS.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

PILOT ACCOUNTS OF OTHER OCCURRENCES IN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER

A PILOT FORMERLY EMPLOYED BY THE OPERATOR, CONTACTED THE SAFETY BOARD TO RECOUNT AN EVENT HE EXPERIENCED IN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER ON NOVEMBER 27, 2005, WHILE ON A REPOSITIONING FLIGHT TO THE WASHINGTON HOSPITAL CENTER.  HE WAS INTERVIEWED BY TELEPHONE, AND HE PROVIDED A WRITTE","THE PILOT REPORTED THAT, DURING HIS FIRST APPROACH TO THE HOSPITAL HELIPAD, THE HELICOPTER ""SHUFFLED,"" AND THE NO. 1 ENGINE RPM INCREASED. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE INCREASED COLLECTIVE PITCH, REDUCED THE THROTTLE ON THE NO. 1 ENGINE, AND ABORTED THE LANDING. HE NOTED THAT THE NO. 1 ENGINE WAS NO LONGER CONTROLLED BY THE FULL AUTHORITY DIGITAL ENGINE CONTROL (FADEC) SYSTEM AND THAT HE HAD TO CONTROL IT MANUALLY. THE PILOT TWICE OVERFLEW THE HELIPAD, AND, WHILE MANEUVERING FOR ANOTHER APPROACH, HE LOST CONTROL OF THE HELICOPTER, AND IT DESCENDED AND STRUCK A TREE AND THE GROUND. EXAMINATION OF THE THROTTLES, THROTTLE LINKAGES, ENGINES, CONTROL SYSTEMS, COCKPIT DISPLAY SYSTEM (CDS), AND FADEC UNITS REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF ANY PREIMPACT MECHANICAL ANOMALIES.
 
POSTACCIDENT TESTING OF THE ENGINES AND ANALYSIS OF DATA RETRIEVED FROM THE CDS AND FADEC UNITS REVEALED THAT THE ACCIDENT PILOT HAD INADVERTENTLY MOVED THE NO. 1 THROTTLE OUT OF ITS NEUTRAL DETENT, PLACING THE ENGINE IN MANUAL MODE AND OUT OF FADEC CONTROL. ALTHOUGH THE PILOT RECOGNIZED THAT THE NO. 1 ENGINE WAS NO LONGER CONTROLLED BY THE FADEC, HE RESPONDED WITH FURTHER MANUAL THROTTLE ADJUSTMENTS AND DID NOT PERFORM THE PUBLISHED PROCEDURE TO RESTORE FADEC CONTROL TO THE ENGINE. THE DATA SHOWED THAT, AS THE PILOT CONTINUED TO MANUALLY CONTROL THE NO. 1 ENGINE, HE SUBSEQUENTLY MOVED THE NO. 2 THROTTLE OUT OF ITS DETENT, PLACING THAT ENGINE ALSO IN MANUAL MODE AND OUT OF FADEC CONTROL. WITH NEITHER ENGINE UNDER FADEC CONTROL, THE PILOT ATTEMPTED CONTROL OF THE ROTOR RPM WHILE CONTROLLING BOTH ENGINES MANUALLY. THIS CONFIGURATION RESULTED IN A HIGH-WORKLOAD SCENARIO IN WHICH IT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING FOR THE PILOT TO CONTROL THE HELICOPTER DURING THE MANEUVERING AND APPROACH-TO-LAND PHASES OF FLIGHT.
 
THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WAS THE ONLY EC-135P1 CDS VARIANT IN THE OPERATOR'S FLEET. ITS ENGINES, ITS DISPLAYS, AND ITS PROCEDURE FOR RESTORING FADEC CONTROL DIFFERED FROM THE EC-135 VARIANT IN WHICH THE ACCIDENT PILOT WAS TRAINED. ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER'S TRAINING GUIDELINES, DIFFERENCES TRAINING IS RECOMMENDED BEFORE A PILOT WHO IS TRAINED ON ANOTHER VARIANT FLIES THE EC-135P1 CDS. HOWEVER, THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE OPERATOR PROVIDED THE ACCIDENT PILOT ONLY ABOUT AN HOUR OF FORMAL DIFFERENCES TRAINING IN THE EC-135P1 CDS, AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE TRAINING ADEQUATELY COVERED THAT VARIANT'S FADEC-RESTORE PROCEDURES AND OTHER ISSUES PERTINENT TO FLIGHT SAFETY. THE PILOT HAD ACCUMULATED ABOUT 914 HOURS OF FLIGHT EXPERIENCE IN EC-135S, WITH ABOUT 45 HOURS IN THE EC-135P1 CDS VARIANT.
 
THE ACCIDENT WAS NOT THE FIRST INDICATION TO THE OPERATOR THAT PILOTS WHO WERE TRAINED IN ANOTHER VARIANT EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTIES WITH THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER. ACCORDING TO ONE OTHER PILOT AND THE ACCIDENT PILOT, THEY EACH PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED EVENTS INVOLVING LOSS OF FADEC CONTROL IN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER (IN NOVEMBER 2005 AND MARCH 2006, RESPECTIVELY) BUT COMPLETED SUCCESSFUL LANDINGS. THE OPERATOR DETERMINED NO MECHANICAL EXPLANATION FOR THE EVENTS AND DID NOT REPORT, AND WAS NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT, THEM TO ITS FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE INSPECTORS. THE OTHER PILOT REPORTED THAT, AT THE TIME OF HIS NOVEMBER 2005 EVENT, HE WAS UNTRAINED IN THE EC-135P1 CDS AND WAS COMPLETELY UNFAMILIAR WITH THE PROCEDURE REQUIRED TO RESTORE FADEC CONTROL. THAT PILOT REPORTED THAT, DURING HIS EVENT, HE OVERSPED THE HELICOPTER'S ENGINES AND THE MAIN ROTOR, AND, AS A RESULT, THE OPERATOR REMOVED THE HELICOPTER FROM SERVICE, CONDUCTED INSPECTIONS OF THE ENGINES AND MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM, AND DETERMINED THAT DIFFERENCES TRAINING WAS NEEDED FOR THE EC-135P1 CDS; HOWEVER, THE OPERATOR FAILED TO ADEQUATELY PROVIDE SUCH TRAINING. BECAUSE THE FAA HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE PREVIOUS EVENTS WITH THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER, IT HAD NO INDICATION TO SUSPECT THAT THE DIFFERENCES TRAINING IMPLEMENTED BY THE OPERATOR WAS DEFICIENT.",THE OPERATOR'S INADEQUATE TRAINING PROGRAM AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE HELICOPTER FOLLOWING HIS INADVERTENT DISABLING OF THE NO. 1 AND THEN THE NO. 2 ENGINE FULL AUTHORITY DIGITAL ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM.

ON MARCH 11, 2007, AT 1259 HAWAIIAN STANDARD TIME, A MCDONNELL DOUGLAS (MD) 369FF HELICOPTER, N911VC, OPERATED BY SMOKY MOUNTAIN HELICOPTERS AND DOING BUSINESS AS INTER-ISLAND HELICOPTERS INC., SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE WHEN IT IMPACTED TREES AND TERRAIN IN THE TOWN OF HAENA ON THE ISLAND OF KAUAI, HAWAII, DURING A PART 135 COMMERCIAL AIR TOUR FLIGHT.  THE FLIGHT DEPARTED FROM THE PORT ALLEN AIRPORT (PAK), HANAPEPE, HAWAII, ON A 55-MINUTE SIGHTSEEING TOUR OF KAUAI.  DURING CRUISE FLIGHT NEAR TUNNEL BEACH IN HAENA, THE TAIL ROTOR OUTPUT SHAFT AND THE TAIL ROTOR BLADES SEPARATED FROM THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX AND FELL INTO THE OCEAN.  THE PILOT EXECUTED AN AUTOROTATION TO A YMCA CAMPGROUND THAT WAS LOCATED NEXT TO THE BEACH.  THE PILOT RECEIVED MINOR INJURIES; HOWEVER, THE RIGHT FRONT SEAT PASSENGER WAS KILLED, AND THE THREE OTHER PASSENGERS RECEIVED SERIOUS INJURIES. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AND A COMPANY FLIGHT PLAN WAS IN EFFECT.

THE PILOT STATED THAT HE REPORTED FOR DUTY ONE HOUR PRIOR TO HIS FIRST FLIGHT OF THE DAY THAT WAS SCHEDULED FOR 0800.  HE CONDUCTED A THOROUGH PREFLIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT THAT INCLUDED AN INSPECTION OF THE TAIL ROTOR SECTION.  THE FLUID LEVELS WERE NORMAL AND THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF CRACKS, DINGS, OR DELAMINATION OF THE SURFACE AND LEADING EDGES OF THE TAIL ROTOR BLADES.  THE PITCH CHANGE LINKS WERE IN GOOD CONDITION AND NO LOOSE BEARINGS WERE NOTED.  HE REPORTED THAT THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX HOUSING APPEARED TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION AND NO CRACKS WERE OBSERVED.  HE CHECKED THE NUTS THAT HOLD THE TAIL ROTOR SECTION IN PLACE.  THE TORQUE SEAL WAS VISIBLE ON EACH NUT, AND HE PHYSICALLY CHECKED EACH ONE TO DETERMINE IF THEY WERE TIGHT.  THE BELLCRANK WAS NOT CRACKED, THE NUTS WERE TIGHT, AND THE COTTER PINS WERE IN PLACE.  

THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE FIRST TWO FLIGHTS OF THE DAY, THE FIRST AT 0800 AND THE SECOND AT 1005, WERE ""WATERFALL"" FLIGHTS.  DURING THE WATERFALL FLIGHTS, HE FLEW TO A PRIVATE LANDING ZONE LOCATED NEAR A WATERFALL.  WHILE IN THE LANDING ZONE, HE SHUT THE HELICOPTER DOWN WHILE THE PASSENGERS VISITED THE WATERFALL FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES.  HE REPORTED THAT HE CONDUCTED A POST FLIGHT INSPECTION ""AS WE ALWAYS DO.""  HE CHECKED THE FLUID LEVELS OF THE ENGINE, MAIN ROTOR TRANSMISSION, AND THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX.  THE FLUID LEVELS WERE NORMAL AND NO LEAKS WERE NOTED.  HE CHECKED THE MAIN ROTOR AND TAIL ROTOR BLADES FOR CRACKS, DINGS, AND DELAMINATION OF THE SURFACE AND LEADING EDGES OF THE BLADES.  DURING BOTH FLIGHTS, THE HELICOPTER OPERATED NORMALLY AND NO ABNORMAL VIBRATIONS WERE NOTED.

THE THIRD FLIGHT WAS A 50 TO 55-MINUTE ISLAND TOUR THAT DEPARTED ABOUT 1210.  THE PILOT REPORTED, ""I VIEWED THE PASSENGERS THAT GOT ON BOARD, JACKETS WERE ON, ZIPPED UP AND SECURED, LIFE JACKET POUCHES WERE ON AND SECURED, CAMERAS WERE SECURED, AND THEY HAD NO HATS OR BAGS WITH THEM.""  

HE REPORTED THAT DURING THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT HE FELT NO ABNORMAL VIBRATIONS IN THE CONTROLS.  ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE FLIGHT, HE WAS FLYING OVER TUNNEL BEACH, ABOUT 50 YARDS FROM THE SHORELINE, AT 1,000 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL (AGL) WITH 80 - 85 KNOTS OF AIRSPEED.  WITHIN A SPLIT-SECOND, HE HEARD TWO LOUD ""BANGS"" AND HE ""FELT IT"" IN HIS SEAT AND PEDALS.  THE NOSE OF THE HELICOPTER PITCHED DOWN, AND THE HELICOPTER YAWED TO THE RIGHT.  HE APPLIED LEFT PEDAL BUT WITHOUT EFFECT.  HE ATTEMPTED TO ""GET MORE FORWARD AIRSPEED,"" BUT EACH TIME HE DID THE HELICOPTER NOSED OVER AND YAWED TO THE RIGHT.  THE RIGHT YAW DEVELOPED INTO A TIGHT SPIN, AND HE REALIZED THAT HE ""LOST HIS TAIL ROTOR.""  HE ADJUSTED THE COLLECTIVE AND THROTTLE TO GET THE ""YAW UNDER CONTROL,"" AND REPORTED THAT, ""IT DID SLOW DOWN THE YAW A LITTLE.""  

HE RECOGNIZED THE YMCA CAMPGROUND AND DECIDED TO EXECUTE AN AUTOROTATION TO THE OPEN FIELD AT THE CAMPGROUND.  HE ENTERED THE AUTOROTATION BY ROLLING OFF THE THROTTLE AND LOWERING THE COLLECTIVE.  HE REPORTED THE ""RIGHT YAW SLOWED EVEN MORE.""  HE ATTEMPTED TO GAIN AIRSPEED AND HE ""FOLLOWED THE RIGHT YAW,"" WHICH MADE THE SPIN SLOWER, AS HE APPROACHED THE CAMPGROUND.  WHEN THE HELICOPTER WAS ABOUT FIVE FEET AGL, HE PULLED THE COLLECTIVE UP TO CUSHION THE LANDING.  AFTER THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED THE TERRAIN, HE CHECKED THE CONDITION OF EACH PASSENGER, AND THEN SECURED THE ENGINE BY TURNING THE MASTER SWITCH OFF AND PULLING THE FUEL SHUTOFF.  HE TOOK THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER AND EXITED THE HELICOPTER.  HE SAW THAT THE TAIL ROTOR BLADES AND OUTPUT SHAFT HAD SEPARATED FROM THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX. 

LOCAL CITIZENS ARRIVED AT THE ACCIDENT SITE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE PILOT AND PASSENGERS.  WITHIN MINUTES, THE LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL WERE ON SITE.  

THERE WERE NUMEROUS WITNESSES TO THE ACCIDENT.  ONE WITNESS REPORTED THAT SHE HEARD A LOUD ""POP"" AND SHE SAW TWO OBJECTS FALLING INTO THE OCEAN.  THE LARGER OBJECT FELL INTO THE OCEAN CLOSE TO SHORE.  THE OTHER OBJECT ""FELL SLOWER IN A FLUTTERING ACTION.""  SHE REPORTED THAT BOTH OBJECTS FELL INTO THE OCEAN WHERE THE WAVES WERE BREAKING AND THE REEF ENDED.  

ANOTHER WITNESS HEARD A ""POP"" AND OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER SPIRALING DOWN.  SHE REPORTED, ""THEN THE SPIRAL TIGHTENED AND SPED UP.  THE OVERHEAD ROTOR COULD BE SEEN AS BLADES (NOT TURNING). THE BLUE AND WHITE BODY OF THE COPTER WAS TURNING SLOWLY AROUND THE ROTOR - RATHER FLAT - NO OBVIOUS PITCH OF THE NOSE UP OR DOWN.  THERE WAS A LARGE THUD - PRESUMABLY IMPACT.""  

A THIRD WITNESS REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER ""STARTED A SLOW SPIRAL TO THE RIGHT AS IT WAS CIRCLING A HOUSE"" AND THAT THE ""SPIRAL TIGHTENED UP AND THERE WERE TWO OF THESE TIGHT SPIRALS - THE MAIN BLADES WERE NOT TURNING VERY RAPIDLY.""  HE REPORTED THAT AT ""NO TIME WAS THE NOSE SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN.  IT WAS A GRADUAL DESCENT BUT NOT IN A VIOLENT DOWN DESCENT.  IT DID A TOTAL OF 3 SPIRALS - ONE GRADUAL AND THE LAST 2 WERE MORE RAPID.""  

THE THREE PASSENGERS ON BOARD THE HELICOPTER WERE INTERVIEWED.  THEY REPORTED THAT THEY DID NOT SEE ANYTHING FALL OUT OF THE HELICOPTER PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT, AND THEY DID NOT OBSERVE BIRDS IN THE AREA.

METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS

THE OBSERVED SURFACE WEATHER AT THE LIHUE AIRPORT, LIHUE, HAWAII, LOCATED ABOUT 17 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, WAS: WIND 010 AT 4 KNOTS, SCATTERED CLOUDS AT 2,800 FEET, OVERCAST 3,700 FEET, TEMPERATURE 23 DEGREES CELSIUS (C), DEW POINT 18 DEGREES C, ALTIMETER 29.94 INCHES OF MERCURY.  

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED THE TREES AND TERRAIN AT THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE YMCA CAMPGROUND AT COORDINATES 22 DEGREES 13.412 MINUTES NORTH LATITUDE, 159 DEGREES 33.231 MINUTES WEST LONGITUDE.  THE ENTIRE HELICOPTER WRECKAGE WAS LOCATED AT THE IMPACT SITE, EXCEPT FOR THE TAIL ROTOR OUTPUT SHAFT AND TAIL ROTOR BLADES.  A BROKEN TREE LIMB ABOUT 15 - 20 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND WAS VISIBLE IN THE TREES LOCATED NEXT TO THE WRECKAGE.  THERE WAS NO GROUND FIRE. 

THE INSPECTION OF THE AIRFRAME REVEALED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE FUSELAGE WITH MAJOR DAMAGE CONCENTRATED AT THE UNDERSIDE OF THE LOWER RIGHT AND FORWARD FUSELAGE SECTION.  THERE WAS EXTENSIVE CRUSHING, TEARING, AND DEFORMATION OF FUSELAGE STRUCTURE AND SKIN PANELS IN THAT AREA.  THE COCKPIT STRUCTURE RECEIVED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE.  THE COCKPIT SEAT SUPPORT STRUCTURE AND COCKPIT FLOORING WERE DISTORTED AND DISPLACED UPWARD.  THE AFT PASSENGER COMPARTMENT WAS INTACT.  THE BENCH SEAT FRAME WAS DISTORTED AND THE LEFT REAR ATTACHING POINT WAS SEPARATED FROM THE FUSELAGE STATION (FS) 124.9 FUSELAGE FRAME AND THE LEFT SEAT LEG HAD SEPARATED FROM ITS FLOOR MOUNTING POINT.  THE KEEL BEAM WAS INTACT WITH SOME DAMAGE TO THE FORWARD SECTION.  THERE WAS NO VISIBLE DAMAGE TO THE MAST SUPPORT STRUCTURE.  THE LOWER SECTION OF THE FUSELAGE IN AND AROUND THE LANDING GEAR ATTACHING POINTS WAS DEFORMED AND BUCKLED.  THE AFT FUSELAGE SECTION WAS DEFORMED AND WRINKLED.  THE COMPOSITE UPPER PYLON WAS INTACT WITH MINOR DAMAGE TO THE FORWARD AND AFT SECTIONS.  THE AFT BOOM FAIRING WAS ATTACHED WITH MINOR VISIBLE WRINKLING OF THE SKIN SURFACES.  THE RIGHT LANDING GEAR'S AFT STRUT WAS FRACTURED AT THE MOUNTING FLANGE AND THE AFT STRUT WAS SEPARATED FROM THE FUSELAGE.  THE FORWARD STRUT WAS STILL ATTACHED AND DISPLACED UPWARD AND AFT.  THE SKID TUBE WAS FRACTURED INTO TWO PIECES AT THE FORWARD SADDLE MOUNT.  THE LEFT LANDING GEAR WAS INTACT AND IT REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE AIRFRAME.  THE TAILBOOM WAS NEARLY FRACTURED INTO TWO SEGMENTS AT ABOUT FS 242.12.  THE MAIN ROTOR HUB ASSEMBLY AND COMPONENTS EXHIBITED MINOR DAMAGE.  ALL FIVE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE STILL ATTACHED TO THE ROTOR HEAD, AND THEY EXHIBITED BENT SPARS, SKIN DELAMINATION, TRAILING EDGE SEPARATION, CUTS AND GOUGES.  THE BLADES WERE BENT UPWARD AT VARYING DEGREES OF 5 - 18 DEGREES.  THE MAIN TRANSMISSION SHOWED NO EXTERIOR DAMAGE AND ROTATED WHEN THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM WAS TURNED BY HAND.  

THE TAIL ROTOR SYSTEM RECEIVED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE.  THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX FRACTURED ACROSS THE CASE ELBOW WITH THE AFT SEGMENT OF THE CASE REMAINING ATTACHED TO THE TAILBOOM EXTENSION.  THE GEARBOX MOUNTING BOLTS WERE IN PLACE AND SECURE.  THERE WAS NO VISIBLE EVIDENCE OF TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX MOVEMENT ON THE TAIL BOOM EXTENSION.  THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX INPUT QUILL ROTATED WHEN MANIPULATED BY HAND.  

THE OUTER SEGMENT OF THE FRACTURED GEARBOX, THE OUTPUT SHAFT WITH ASSOCIATED BEARING SETS, THE FS 284 BELLCRANK, THE FRACTURED TAILBOOM CONTROL ROD, THE TAIL ROTOR PITCH CHANGE ASSEMBLY, THE DRIVE FORK WITH TEETERING BEARINGS, AND THE TAIL ROTOR HUB AND BLADES, HAD SEPARATED FROM THE HELICOPTER AND WERE NOT LOCATED DURING THE ONSITE PORTION OF THE INVESTIGATION.

THE AVAILABLE SECTION OF THE FRACTURED TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX WAS SENT TO THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD'S (NTSB) MATERIALS LABORATORY FOR INSPECTION.  THE INITIAL INSPECTION OF THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX ON MARCH 22, 2007, REVEALED THAT ALL THE FRACTURES WERE TYPICAL OF OVERSTRESS FRACTURES.  

POLICE SCUBA DIVERS SEARCHED FOR THE TAIL ROTOR OUTPUT SHAFT AND TAIL ROTOR BLADES FOR TWO DAYS, BUT WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE MISSING PARTS.  HIGH SURF CONDITIONS PREVENTED DIVERS FROM CONTINUING THE SEARCH FOR THE PARTS.  WITHIN WEEKS OF THE ACCIDENT, THE MISSING PARTS WERE RETRIEVED FROM THE TUNNELS BEECH AREA AND WERE SENT TO THE NTSB MATERIALS LABORATORY FOR INSPECTION.    

TESTS AND RESEARCH

THE TAIL ROTOR BLADE ASSEMBLY, THE AFT PORTION OF THE TAIL BOOM, THE TAIL BOOM EXTENSION, AND THE FRACTURED PORTION OF THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX WERE INSPECTED AT THE NTSB MATERIALS LABORATORY.  THE MATERIALS LABORATORY REPORTED THAT THE TAIL ROTOR BLADE ASSEMBLY FRACTURED THROUGH THE ROOT FITTING, P/N 369A1624-3, IN THE GENERAL AREA THAT COINCIDED WITH A HOLE FOR THE BLADE RETENTION BOLT.  THE ROOT FITTING CONTAINED A 1-INCH NOMINAL DIAMETER LONGITUDINAL HUB BORE WITH A TAPERED (CONICAL) HOLE BOTTOM.  A RELIEF RADIUS WAS LOCATED BETWEEN THE HUB BORE AND THE CONICAL HOLE BOTTOM.  A 0.12-INCH NOMINAL DIAMETER HOLE EXTENDED BELOW THE CONICAL HOLE BOTTOM.  THE ROOT FITTING ALSO CONTAINED A HOLE FOR THE TAIL ROTOR RETENTION BOLT (A SMALLER HOLE THAT WAS ORIENTED PERPENDICULAR TO THE HUB BORE).

ON THE TOP (CAMBER) SIDE OF THE BLADE, THE FRACTURE EXTENDED BETWEEN THE TOP SURFACE AND THE RELIEF RADIUS OF THE HUB BORE.  AT THE RELIEF RADIUS, THE FRACTURE EXTENDED AROUND APPROXIMATELY 40 PERCENT OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE HUB BORE AND INTERSECTED THE HOLE FOR THE BLADE RETENTION BOLT.  ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RETENTION BOLT HOLE, THE FRACTURE EXTENDED THROUGH TO THE BOTTOM (NON-CAMBER) SURFACE INBOARD OF THE RELIEF RADIUS.

BENCH BINOCULAR MICROSCOPE EXAMINATION OF THE ROOT FITTING REVEALED THE FRACTURE FACE CONTAINED RADIAL MARKS THAT EMANATED FROM THE HUB BORE.  CLOSER EXAMINATION OF THE FRACTURE FACE REVEALED CRACK ARREST MARKS TYPICAL OF A FATIGUE CRACKING THAT EMANATED FROM MULTIPLE ORIGINS AT THE RELIEF RADIUS BETWEEN THE HUB BORE AND CONICAL HOLE BOTTOM.  THE ARC LENGTH OF THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN FATIGUE CRACK ALONG THE RELIEF RADIUS MEASURED APPROXIMATELY 0.6 INCH.  THE FATIGUE CRACK ORIGIN AREA WAS LOCATED ADJACENT TO THE TOP SURFACE OF THE ROOT FITTING AND SLIGHTLY TOWARD THE TRAILING EDGE.  VARIOUS AREAS OF THE FRACTURE FACE SHOWED EVIDENCE OF FATIGUE CRACK ARREST MARKS INDICATING THAT THE FATIGUE CRACK PROPAGATED TOWARD THE EXTERIOR TOP SURFACE, AROUND BOTH SIDES OF THE BORE, APPROXIMATELY HALF WAY AROUND THE ROOT FITTING CROSS SECTION, AND INTO THE HOLE FOR THE BLADE RETENTION BOLT.  THE FATIGUE CRACK RE-INITIATED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HOLE FOR THE BLADE RETENTION BOLT AND PROPAGATED AS MUCH AS 0.3 INCH. 

A LONGITUDINAL-RADIAL SECTION WAS MADE THROUGH THE HUB BORE, RELIEF RADIUS, AND PORTION OF THE CONICAL BOTTOM.   THE SECTION WAS ENCASED IN A METALLURGICAL MOUNT AND POLISHED.  EXAMINATION OF THE METALLURGICAL SECTION REVEALED THAT THE RELIEF RADIUS WAS SIMILAR TO THE SIZE OF THE MACHINE MARKS IN THE BORE.  THE RELIEF RADIUS MEASURED APPROXIMATELY 0.001 INCH, MUCH LESS THAN SPECIFIED BY THE ENGINEERING DRAWING (0.12 INCH AND 0.15 INCH).

ON DECEMBER 29, 2007, AT 1535 CENTRAL STANDARD TIME, A BELL 206L1, N211EL, OPERATED BY AIR LOGISTICS LLC., IMPACTED WATER DURING AN APPROACH TO THE OFFSHORE PLATFORM SOUTH PASS 38 IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.  ONE PASSENGER WAS FATALLY INJURED, THE COMMERCIAL PILOT SUSTAINED SERIOUS INJURIES, AND TWO OTHER PASSENGERS RECEIVED MINOR INJURIES.  THE FLIGHT ORIGINATED FROM OFFSHORE PLATFORM CHANDELEUR 63 AT 1502 AND WAS DESTINED FOR SOUTH PASS 38, BOTH IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AND A COMPANY FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE TITLE 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS PART 135 ON-DEMAND AIR TAXI.

INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED WITH THE PILOT REVEALED THAT WHILE EN ROUTE TO SOUTH PASS 38, WEATHER WAS ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 500 FEET AND 5 MILES VISIBILITY.  WHEN THE PILOT APPROACHED THE PLATFORM, WEATHER DEGRADED TO APPROXIMATELY 300 FEET AND 1 STATUTE MILE VISIBILITY.  THE PILOT DESCENDED AND ELECTED TO CONTINUE AN APPROACH TO SOUTH PASS 38 DESPITE VIOLATING COMPANY DESIGNATED WEATHER MINIMUMS OF 500 FEET AND 3 MILES VISIBILITY.  AT APPROXIMATELY 1 MILE FROM THE PLATFORM, THE PILOT MANEUVERED THE HELICOPTER ""TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT"" DURING THE APPROACH IN AN ATTEMPT TO SLOW THE HELICOPTER.  THE PILOT PLANNED TO CIRCLE TO RIGHT OF THE PLATFORM AND LAND INTO THE WIND.  WITH A PREVAILING TAIL WIND, THE PILOT SLOWED THE HELICOPTER THROUGH 20 TO 25 KNOTS AND BEGAN DESCENDING.  THE PILOT STATED THAT HE COULD NOT SENSE HOW FAST THE HELICOPTER WAS DESCENDING AND BEGAN FEELING VIBRATIONS THROUGH THE CONTROLS.  FORWARD CYCLIC WAS APPLIED AND THE PILOT PULLED THE COLLECTIVE TO ADD POWER AND STARTED A SLIGHT LEFT TURN TO STRAIGHTEN THE HELICOPTER.  THE VIBRATIONS BECAME STRONGER AND THE PILOT WAS ATTEMPTING TO RECOVER THE HELICOPTER WHEN IT IMPACTED THE WATER.  NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO DEPLOY THE EXTERNAL SKID-MOUNTED FLOATS.

ALL PERSONNEL SURVIVED THE IMPACT AND WERE ABLE TO EGRESS THE HELICOPTER.  THE EXTERNAL-MOUNTED LIFE RAFTS WERE NOT DEPLOYED PRIOR TO THE HELICOPTER SINKING.  THE SURVIVORS ATTEMPTED TO INDIVIDUALLY SWIM TO THE LANDING PLATFORM BUT WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL.  FISHING BOATS AND THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD (USCG) RESCUED ALL THE SURVIVORS.  TWO PASSENGERS WERE RECOVERED AFTER APPROXIMATELY TWO AND ONE-HALF HOURS IN THE WATER.  ONE PASSENGER SUSTAINED FATAL INJURIES FROM DROWNING AND HYPOTHERMIA.  THE PILOT WAS RECOVERED LAST HAVING BEEN IN THE WATER OVER FOUR HOURS.

IN ADDITION, THE PILOT HELD A FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR LICENSE WITH HELICOPTER, HELICOPTER INSTRUMENT, AIRPLANE SINGLE-ENGINE LAND, AND AIRPLANE INSTRUMENT RATINGS.  A SECOND-CLASS AIRMAN MEDICAL CERTIFICATE WAS ISSUED ON FEBRUARY 13, 2007 WITH NO RESTRICTIONS.  THE PILOT BEGAN NEW HIRE TRAINING ON JUNE 13, 2007.  HELICOPTER UNDERWATER EGRESS TRAINING (HUET) AND WATER SURVIVAL TRAINING WERE BOTH ACCOMPLISHED ON JUNE 21, 2007.  ON JULY 16, 2007, THE PILOT COMPLETED ALL OF THE OPERATOR'S INITIAL OPERATING EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS AND WAS PERMITTED TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.  AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT THE PILOT REPORTED HAVING ACCUMULATED 2,877 TOTAL HOURS, 2,480 HOURS OF ROTORCRAFT TIME WITH 303 HOURS IN THE SAME MAKE AND MODEL AS THE MISHAP HELICOPTER.  

THE PILOT WAS SCHEDULED ON A SEVEN DAYS ON THEN SEVEN DAYS OFF SCHEDULE.  THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT OCCURRED ON DAY THREE OF HIS ROTATION.  ACCORDING THE COMPANY FLIGHT RECORDS, THE DAY PRIOR, DECEMBER 28, WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE PILOT LANDED AT AND DEPARTED FROM SOUTH PASS 38.  ON THIS DAY THE PILOT ALSO CHOSE NOT TO CONTINUE TO ANOTHER DESTINATION DUE TO WEATHER BELOW COMPANY MINIMUMS.

THE PILOT WAS INVOLVED IN A PREVIOUS ACCIDENT ON MAY 28, 2006, WHICH INVOLVED A ROBINSON R-22 WHICH WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED WHEN THE HELICOPTER SETTLED WITH POWER DURING A TAXI DEMONSTRATION.  THIS ACCIDENT WAS INVESTIGATED BY THE NTSB UNDER ACCIDENT NUMBER NYC06CA125.  THE PILOT INFORMED AIR LOGISTICS OF HIS PREVIOUS ACCIDENT DURING THE HIRING PROCESS.

HELICOPTER INFORMATION

THE 7-SEAT, SINGLE-ENGINE HELICOPTER, SERIAL NUMBER 45251, WAS MANUFACTURED IN 1979.  THE HELICOPTER WAS EQUIPPED WITH SKID-MOUNTED APICAL FLOATS WITH TWO EXTERNALLY MOUNTED LIFE RAFTS.  AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, THE AIRFRAME HAD ACCUMULATED APPROXIMATELY 23,767 HOURS.  THE HELICOPTER WAS POWERED WITH A 500 HORSEPOWER ALLISON 250-C-28 TURBO SHAFT ENGINE, SERIAL NUMBER CAE 860088.  THE ENGINE HAD ACCUMULATED APPROXIMATELY 15,504 HOURS WITH 1,002 HOURS SINCE MAJOR OVERHAUL.  THE LAST INSPECTION PERFORMED WAS AN APPROVED AIRWORTHINESS INSPECTION PROGRAM (AAIP) CONDUCTED ON DECEMBER 19, 2007 AT AN AIRFRAME TOTAL TIME OF 23,732.4 HOURS.  THE HELICOPTER HAD FLOWN 35 HOURS SINCE THIS INSPECTION.

THE APICAL EMERGENCY FLOATS WITH LIFE RAFT SYSTEM COMPLIED WITH SUPPLEMENTAL TYPE CERTIFICATE (STC) NUMBER SR 01535 LA.  THE INSTALLED APICAL SYSTEM ALLOWED FOR ACTIVATION OF THE FLOATATION SYSTEMS THROUGH ONE PRESSURE ACTIVATED LEVER FOR THE EMERGENCY FLOATATION SYSTEM LOCATED ON THE CYCLIC, ONE INTERNAL SWITCH ON THE CENTER CONSOLE FOR THE EXTERNAL LIFE RAFT SYSTEM, AND TWO RED HANDLES LOCATED ON BOTH FORWARD STRUTS OF THE SKIDS TO ACTIVATE THE EXTERNAL LIFE RAFT SYSTEM.  PLACARDS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO ASSIST IN INFORMING PERSONNEL HOW TO DEPLOY THE LIFE RAFT SYSTEM WHEN NEAR THE EXTERNAL HANDLES.  A GRAPHICAL DEPICTION OF EXTERNAL FLOAT ACTIVATION WAS PROVIDED ON THE COMPANY'S PASSENGER SAFETY CARD.

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

AT 1500, AN AIR LOGISTICS WEATHER ALERT WAS ISSUED INFORMING PILOTS THAT SHOWERS CONTINUED TO DIMINISH BUT THAT CEILING AND VISIBILITY REMAIN ""A CONCERN.""  CEILINGS OF 600 FEET WERE REPORTED SOUTH OF FOURCHON AND VISIBILITY AS LOW AS 4 STATUTE MILES IN HEAVIER DOWNBURSTS.  THERE IS NO RECORD OF THE PILOT OBTAINING THIS WEATHER ALERT.

THE WATER TEMPERATURE IN THE AREA OF THE ACCIDENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 49 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

COMMUNICATIONS

THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT WAS CONDUCTING OPERATIONS UNDER FLIGHT FOLLOWING BY AIR LOGISTICS.  THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF TRACKING AND MONITORING USING SEVERAL PROGRAMS WITH RADIO TRANSMISSIONS AND TELEPHONE CALLS TO COMMUNICATE FLIGHT INFORMATION.  FLIGHT FOLLOWING IS LOCATED AT AIR LOGISTIC HEADQUARTERS AND IS STAFFED WITH SIX RADIO OPERATORS WHO ARE SCHEDULED TO WORK 0600-1800.  

SKY CONNECT UTILIZES 66 IRIDIUM LOW-ORBIT SATELLITES AND ON-BOARD ""TRACKER-SOP"" HELICOPTER COMPONENTS TO PROVIDE BOTH COMMUNICATIONS AND POSITION REPORTS.  THE SYSTEM WAS CONFIGURED TO PROVIDE A POSITION REPORT EVERY THREE MINUTES.  AT 1533:36 AN AUTOMATED REPORT SENT A POSITION REPORT ALONG WITH THE FLIGHT PARAMETERS OF 65 KNOTS GROUNDSPEED, ALTITUDE OF 308 FEET, HEADING 202 DEGREES.  NO REPORT WAS MADE AT 1536.

HELICOPTER STATUS IS TRACKED BY AIR LOGISTICS BY UTILIZING DATAFLYT'S FLYTWATCH SOFTWARE.  THIS SOFTWARE ROUGHLY WORKS WITH A THREE STEP-PROCESS TO PLACE A HELICOPTER IN EITHER ""LAND"" OR ""CHECK"" STATUS.  THE FIRST STEP REQUIRES THE RADIO OPERATOR TO SELECT A HELICOPTER TO BRING UP POSITION DATA.  THE SECOND REQUIRES INFORMATION TO BE ENTERED IN THE APPROPRIATE BLOCK.  THE THIRD STEP IS TO PLACE THE HELICOPTER IN EITHER ""LAND"" OR ""CHECK"" STATUS.  PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT, PLACING THE HELICOPTER IN ""CHECK"" STATUS WOULD TRIGGER AN UPDATE REQUEST IN TWO HOURS.  IN RESPONSE TO THE ACCIDENT, AIR LOGISTICS CONTACTED THE SOFTWARE VENDOR AND CHANGED THE TWO-HOUR REMINDER TO 30 MINUTES AND INCORPORATED AN ADDITIONAL QUERY SCREEN TO PREVENT CONTROLLERS FROM ""LANDING"" THE WRONG HELICOPTER.

A WRITTEN STATEMENT PREPARED BY THE RADIO OPERATOR WAS PROVIDED TO THE NTSB BY AIR LOGISTICS.  A RADIO OPERATOR WAS TRACKING N211EL AS IT FLEW TO SOUTH PASS 38.  WHEN THE PILOT LIFTED OFF FROM CHANDELEUR 63, HE ESTIMATED HIS LANDING TIME AT SOUTH PASS 38 AS 1550.  AT 1533 THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE WAS WITHIN THREE NAUTICAL MILES OF SOUTH PASS 38.  AT 1551, THE RADIO OPERATOR TWICE QUERIED THE PILOT OF N211EL WHETHER OR NOT THE HELICOPTER LANDED.  SEVERAL SECONDS PRIOR ANOTHER HELICOPTER REPORTED LANDING.  THE RADIO OPERATOR RECALLED HAVING 1EL'S DATA ON THE SCREEN BUT MUST HAVE NOT COMPLETELY PRESSED ""ESC"" ON THE KEYBOARD TO CHANGE HELICOPTERS AND MISTAKENLY ""LANDED"" THE WRONG HELICOPTER.  A REVIEW OF THE FLIGHT FOLLOWING DATABASE SHOWS A LAND TIME OF 1551 FOR HELICOPTER N211EL.  WHEN THE RADIO OPERATOR TWICE QUERIED N211EL OF LANDING STATUS, NO ANSWER WAS GIVEN.  SINCE THE HELICOPTER WAS PLACED INTO A ""LAND"" STATUS, NO OVERDUE NOTIFICATIONS WERE TRIGGERED BY THE COMPUTER DATAFLYT PROGRAM.  DESPITE NUMEROUS REQUESTS, THE RADIO OPERATOR REFUSED TO PROVIDE ANY FURTHER INFORMATION.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

AN UNDERWATER RECOVERY WAS ACCOMPLISHED ON JANUARY 4, 2008.  THE WRECKAGE CONSISTED OF THE MAIN FUSELAGE TO INCLUDE THE FORWARD AND AFT SECTIONS.  THE MAIN ROTOR HUB ASSEMBLY WAS RECOVERED STILL ATTACHED TO THE HELICOPTER'S TRANSMISSION.  BOTH MAIN ROTOR BLADES EXHIBITED OVERLOAD FRACTURES OUTBOARD OF THE DOUBLERS.  THE TAIL BOOM AND TAIL ROTOR ASSEMBLY WERE SEPARATED AND WERE NOT LOCATED.

SURVIVAL ASPECTS

THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED THE WATER IN A NOSE-DOWN ATTITUDE WITH A LEFT BANK.  ALL PERSONNEL SUCCESSFULLY INFLATED THEIR LIFE VESTS.  THE HELICOPTER WAS RESTING IN THE WATER AT AN ANGLE THAT PRECLUDED THE PILOT FROM DEPLOYING THE EXTERNAL LIFE RAFTS.  THE PILOT STATED THAT HE DIRECTED A PASSENGER TO DEPLOY THE LIFE RAFT, BUT THE PASSENGER DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE PILOT'S DIRECTIONS.  THE HELICOPTER REMAINED AFLOAT FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE BEFORE IT SANK BENEATH THE WAVES.  SINCE THE SURVIVORS WERE APPROXIMATELY 100 YARDS FROM THE LANDING PLATFORM, ONE PASSENGER SUGGESTED THAT THEY SHOULD SWIM TO THE PLATFORM.  THE PILOT AGREED AND ALL FOUR ATTEMPTED TO SWIM TO THE PLATFORM.  THE HIGH SEA STATE SEPARATED THE SURVIVORS AND THE CURRENT FROM THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA SWEPT THE SURVIVORS AWAY FROM PLATFORM.  THE SURVIVORS ESTIMATED THE WAVE HEIGHTS TO BE 6 TO 8 FEET HIGH.

AT 1551, THE RADIO OPERATOR WHO WAS PROVIDING FLIGHT FOLLOWING FOR N211EL MISTAKENLY RECORDED THE HELICOPTER AS LANDED.  AT 1625, THE BASE MANAGER (BM) AT VENICE, LOUISIANA, CALLED THE LANDING PLATFORM ATTEMPTING TO LOCATE THE PILOT AND THEN CALLED FOR INFORMATION FROM FLIGHT FOLLOWING.  AT 1650, THE BM AND DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS (DO) DECIDED TO MOVE A FIELD BOAT TO LOCATE THE HELICOPTER AND PILOT WITH A 90 MINUTE EN ROUTE TIME AND A 1730 LAUNCH TIME OF THE NIGHT HELICOPTER.  AT 1703 THE NIGHT HELICOPTER WAS ALERTED.  DATA AVAILABLE TO THE DO CATEGORIZED THE PLATFORM AS BEING MANNED, SO AT 1725 THE DO DECIDED NOT TO INVOLVE ANY EXTERNAL AGENCIES AND GAVE THE NIGHT HELICOPTER THE AUTHORITY TO LAUNCH.  HOWEVER, DUE TO POOR WEATHER, THE NIGHT HELICOPTER COULD NOT LAUNCH.  AT 1747, THE OPERATOR ATTEMPTED TO REACH THE PILOT BY THE PILOT'S PERSONAL CELL PHONE AND THE TELEPHONES AT SOUTH PASS 38.  THERE IS NO RECORD OF WHETHER CONTACT WAS ATTEMPTED VIA THE HELICOPTER'S IRIDIUM PHONE.

AT APPROXIMATELY 1750, ONE OF THE SURVIVORS SPOTTED A SHRIMP TRAWLER AND YELLED FOR ASSISTANCE.  THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD (USCG) RECEIVED A MAYDAY CALL FROM A SHRIMP TRAWLER INFORMING THE USCG OF PEOPLE FOUND IN THE WATER.  AT 1820, THE TRAWLER TRANSMITTED THE ACCIDENT INFORMATION.  AIR LOGISTICS' VENICE BASE MANAGER WAS NOTIFIED BY A PERSON AT A LOCAL BOAT RENTAL OF THE RADIO CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE TRAWLER AND THE USCG.  AIR LOGISTICS CONTACTED THE USCG AND EXCHANGED INFORMATION.  BOTH AIR LOGISTICS AND THE USCG LAUNCHED HELICOPTERS BUT NEITHER COULD ARRIVE ON SCENE DUE TO BAD EN ROUTE WEATHER.  AT 1900 A USCG BOAT ARRIVED AND BEGAN SEARCHING FOR THE PILOT.  AT 1948, THE USCG REPORTED FINDING THE PILOT.  THE PILOT HAD BEEN IN THE WATER OVER FOUR HOURS.

TESTS AND RESEARCH

IN HIS INTERVIEW AND WRITTEN STATEMENT, THE PILOT DID NOT REPORT ANY LOSS OF POWER OR CONTROL MALFUNCTION.  NO WARNING LIGHTS OR AURAL WARNINGS WERE DETECTED BY THE PILOT OR LEFT SEAT PASSENGER DURING THE ACCIDENT SEQUENCE.  A SURVIVING PASSENGER WHO SAT IN THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT ALSO REPORTED NO AURAL WARNINGS PRIOR TO IMPACT.

AN EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER WRECKAGE AND ENGINE WAS CONDUCTED BY THE NTSB AND FAA WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE AIRFRAME AND ENGINE MANUFACTURERS.

DURING THE EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER WRECKAGE, FLIGHT CONTROL CONTINUITY WAS ESTABLISHED EXCLUDING THE TAIL BOOM ASSEMBLY, WHICH WAS NOT RECOVERED.  DAMAGE SUSTAINED TO THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE ROTOR SYSTEM BEING DRIVEN WITH POWER AT THE TIME OF IMPACT.  NO PRE-IMPACT ANOMALIES WERE DISCOVERED WHICH WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED NORMAL OPERATION OF THE HELICOPTER.

THE ENGINE SUSTAINED CORROSION DAMAGE DUE TO SALT WATER EXPOSURE.  THE MAIN ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT COULD NOT BE ROTATED.  ALL PNEUMATIC, OIL, AND FUEL LINES WERE FOUND SECURED.  THE FUEL CONTROL POINTER WAS NOTED IN THE ""100%"" POSITION.  NO DAMAGE WAS NOTED TO THE IMPELLER OF THE COMPRESSOR SECTION.  THE TURBINE SECTION WAS EXAMINED AND NO VISUAL DAMAGE WAS NOTED.  NO ANOMALIES WERE DISCOVERED WHICH WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED THE NORMAL OPERATION OF THE ENGINE.","ACCORDING TO AN INTERVIEW WITH THE PILOT, WHILE EN ROUTE TO AN UNMANNED OFFSHORE PLATFORM SOUTH PASS 38 IN THE GULF OF MEXICO, THE CLOUD CEILINGS WERE ABOUT 500 FEET AND THE VISIBILITY WAS ABOUT 5 MILES. HOWEVER, AS THE HELICOPTER NEARED THE DESTINATION PLATFORM, THE FLIGHT ENTERED DETERIORATING WEATHER. THE PILOT ESTIMATED THAT THE CLOUD CEILING WAS ABOUT 300 FEET AND THAT THE VISIBILITY WAS ABOUT 1 MILE WHEN HE BEGAN CIRCLING TO LAND ON THE PLATFORM. ALTHOUGH THE WEATHER CONDITIONS DID NOT MEET AIR LOGISTICS’ OPERATING MINIMUMS, WHICH REQUIRED A 500 FOOT CLOUD CEILING AND 3 MILES OF VISIBILITY, THE PILOT DECIDED TO CONTINUE TO THE DESTINATION PLATFORM, DESPITE HAVING THE OPTION TO DIVERT TO ANOTHER STATION. 

ABOUT 1 MILE FROM THE PLATFORM, AS THE PILOT WAS MANEUVERING IN AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THE AIRSPEED, THE HELICOPTER BEGAN AN INADVERTENT DESCENT AND THEN ENTERED AN AERODYNAMIC BUFFET THAT HINDERED THE PILOT’S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN STRAIGHT AND LEVEL FLIGHT. THE BUFFET WAS MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY THE HELICOPTER ENTERING TRANSVERSE FLOW EFFECT (UNEQUAL LIFT VECTORS BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR PORTIONS OF THE ROTOR DISC) AND BY A REDUCTION IN LIFT VECTORS, WHICH RESULTED FROM THE TAILWIND THAT WAS PRESENT. AFTER ENCOUNTERING THE BUFFET, THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE HELICOPTER OR TO STOP THE HELICOPTER’S DESCENT BEFORE IT IMPACTED THE WATER.
 
THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WAS EQUIPPED WITH EXTERNALLY MOUNTED FLOATS, WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED BY ACTUATING A TRIGGER MOUNTED ON THE CYCLIC. THE HELICOPTER WAS ALSO EQUIPPED WITH TWO EXTERNALLY MOUNTED LIFERAFTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED EITHER BY PULLING AN INTERIOR T-HANDLE NEAR THE PILOT’S LEFT LEG OR BY PULLING ONE OF THE TWO EXTERNALLY MOUNTED T-HANDLES ON THE HELICOPTER’S SKID CROSS BAR. ACCORDING TO A SUPPLEMENTAL TYPE CERTIFICATE FOR THE HELICOPTER, A PLACARD WAS ONLY MOUNTED NEAR THE INTERIOR T-HANDLE.
 
ACCORDING TO A PILOT INTERVIEW AND A WRITTEN STATEMENT OBTAINED BY AIR LOGISTICS, THE PILOT DID NOT ATTEMPT TO ACTIVATE THE HELICOPTER’S FLOTATION SYSTEM OR LIFERAFTS BEFORE WATER IMPACT BECAUSE HE WAS PREOCCUPIED WITH RECOVERING FROM THE BUFFET. THE ACCIDENT PILOT PROVIDED NO INDICATION WHY HE DID NOT DEPLOY THE EXTERNAL LIFERAFTS USING THE INTERNAL T-HANDLE WHEN THE HELICOPTER ENTERED THE WATER, EVEN THOUGH HE HAD RECEIVED TRAINING ON EXTERNAL LIFERAFT DEPLOYMENTS. AIR LOGISTICS’ TRAINING PROGRAM AND OPERATING MANUAL EXPECTED COMPANY PILOTS TO DEPLOY THE FLOATS BEFORE WATER IMPACT BUT DID NOT ADDRESS PILOT EXPECTATIONS IN THE EVENT OF WATER IMPACT WITHOUT FLOATS DEPLOYED. LACKING ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE, THE PILOT REVERTED TO HIS WATER SURVIVAL TRAINING AND IMMEDIATELY EXITED THE HELICOPTER.
 
ALL OF THE OCCUPANTS SURVIVED THE IMPACT, EXITED THE HELICOPTER, AND INFLATED THEIR LIFEJACKETS. THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO REACH THE EXTERNAL LIFERAFT T-HANDLES ON THE SKIDS AND ATTEMPTED TO DIRECT THE PASSENGERS TO DEPLOY THE LIFERAFTS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE PILOT HAD NOT CONDUCTED A PASSENGER BRIEFING (INCLUDING INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO DEPLOY THE LIFERAFT SYSTEM), THE PASSENGERS DID NOT KNOW THAT LIFERAFTS WERE AVAILABLE EXTERNALLY AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW TO DEPLOY THE LIFERAFTS USING THE EXTERNAL T-HANDLES BEFORE THE HELICOPTER SANK. UNDER 14 CFR 135.117, THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) REQUIRES PILOTS TO ENSURE THAT, BEFORE FLIGHT, ALL PASSENGERS ON FLIGHTS INVOLVING EXTENDED OVERWATER OPERATIONS ARE ORALLY BRIEFED ON DITCHING PROCEDURES AND THE USE OF REQUIRED FLOTATION EQUIPMENT; HOWEVER, THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT DID NOT MEET THE 14 CFR 1.1 DEFINITION OF AN EXTENDED OVERWATER OPERATION BECAUSE IT WAS OPERATING WITHIN 50 NAUTICAL MILES OF THE SHORELINE.
 
PER THE AIR LOGISTICS FLIGHT OPERATIONS MANUAL (FOM), A PASSENGER BRIEFING WAS REQUIRED THAT WOULD HAVE INCLUDED THE LOCATION OF EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS SEAT BELTS, EXITS, LIFEJACKETS, AND FIRE EXTINGUISHERS. THE FOM DID NOT SPECIFY THAT LIFERAFT LOCATIONS WERE TO BE PART OF THE BRIEFING.[2] REGARDLESS, NO PASSENGER SAFETY BRIEFING WAS PROVIDED BEFORE DEPARTURE. AIR LOGISTICS PASSENGER BRIEFING CARDS, WHICH WERE STOWED IN A POUCH ON THE CABIN SIDEWALL FOR EACH PASSENGER SEAT, PROVIDED DIRECTIONS ON HOW TO OPERATE DIFFERENT EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT; HOWEVER, THE BRIEFING CARDS DID NOT PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON WHICH EQUIPMENT WAS INSTALLED ON THE HELICOPTER. IN ADDITION, AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, THERE WERE NO PLACARDS TO AID IN RECOGNITION OF THE EXTERNAL LIFERAFT ACTIVATION HANDLES.

THE PASSENGERS AND THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO SWIM TO THE PLATFORM, WHICH WAS ABOUT 100 YARDS FROM THE IMPACT LOCATION, BUT WERE SEPARATED BY HIGH WAVES AND WERE MOVED AWAY FROM THE PLATFORM BY THE CURRENT. ABOUT 1551, AN AIR LOGISTICS RADIO OPERATOR MISTAKENLY RECORDED THE HELICOPTER AS “LANDED” IN THE COMPANY’S FLIGHT-FOLLOWING DATABASE. BECAUSE THE HELICOPTER WAS PLACED IN THE “LANDED” STATUS, THE FLIGHT-TRACKING PROGRAM DID NOT TRIGGER ANY OVERDUE NOTIFICATIONS. ABOUT 34 MINUTES LATER (1 HOUR AFTER THE CRASH), THE ERROR WAS DISCOVERED BY THE AIR LOGISTICS BASE MANAGER IN VENICE, LOUISIANA, BECAUSE THE PILOT HAD NOT REPORTED HIS STATUS BEFORE SUNSET. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY DIVERTED A FIELD BOAT TOWARD THE OFFSHORE PLATFORM TO SEARCH FOR THE HELICOPTER; HOWEVER, THE FIELD BOAT WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO AID THE SURVIVORS. THE WEATHER CONDITIONS PRECLUDED THE LAUNCH OF ANOTHER HELICOPTER TO ASSIST IN THE SEARCH. ABOUT 1 HOUR 15 MINUTES AFTER THE CRASH, THE CREWMEMBERS OF A SHRIMP TRAWLER CONTACTED THE U.S. COAST GUARD TO REPORT THAT THEY HAD RETRIEVED TWO SURVIVORS AND A DECEASED PASSENGER FROM THE WATER. THE WATER TEMPERATURE NEAR THE ACCIDENT LOCATION WAS ABOUT 49 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, AND THE PASSENGER DIED OF HYPOTHERMIA SECONDARY TO ASPHYXIA FROM DROWNING. A COAST GUARD SHIP RESCUED THE SEVERELY HYPOTHERMIC PILOT MORE THAN 4 HOURS AFTER THE ESTIMATED TIME OF THE CRASH. 
THE PILOT DID NOT REPORT ENGINE POWER LOSS OR CONTROL MALFUNCTION. THE PASSENGERS DID NOT REPORT SEEING ANY WARNING LIGHTS OR HEARING ANY AURAL WARNINGS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. AN EXAMINATION OF THE AIRFRAME AND ENGINE DID NOT REVEAL ANY ANOMALIES THAT WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED SAFE FLIGHT OR THE PRODUCTION OF ENGINE POWER.

ON OCTOBER 20, 2008, THE NTSB ISSUED TWO RECOMMENDATIONS PERTAINING TO THIS ACCIDENT. SAFETY RECOMMENDATION A-08-83 ASKED FOR THE INSTALLATION OF A PLACARD FOR EACH EXTERNAL T HANDLE ON TURBINE-POWERED HELICOPTERS WITH EXTERNALLY MOUNTED LIFERAFTS THAT CLEARLY IDENTIFIES THE LOCATION OF AND PROVIDES ACTIVATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HANDLE. SAFETY RECOMMENDATION A 08-84 RECOMMENDED THAT ALL OPERATORS OF TURBINE-POWERED HELICOPTERS BE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCATION AND ACTIVATION OF INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL LIFERAFTS IN PILOT PREFLIGHT SAFETY BRIEFINGS TO PASSENGERS BEFORE EACH TAKEOFF. BOTH RECOMMENDATIONS ARE CLASSIFIED “OPEN—RESPONSE RECEIVED.”

SAFETY RECOMMENDATION A-07-88, WHICH THE NTSB ISSUED ON OCTOBER 19, 2007, ALSO APPLIES TO THIS ACCIDENT. IN THE RECOMMENDATION, THE NTSB ASKED THE FAA TO REQUIRE THAT ALL OFFSHORE HELICOPTER OPERATORS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO PROVIDE THEIR FLIGHT CREWS WITH BEACON-EQUIPPED PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICES; SAFETY RECOMMENDATION A-07-88 IS CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED “OPEN—ACCEPTABLE RESPONSE,” BASED ON THE FAA’S PLAN TO CONSULT WITH OPERATORS ON THE BEST WAYS TO INCREASE THE CHANCE OF SURVIVAL IN A DITCHING AND THE ISSUANCE OF AN INFORMATION FOR OPERATORS THAT DESCRIBES RECOMMENDATIONS TO MITIGATE THE RISKS AND HAZARDS FOR HELICOPTERS THAT MAY HAVE TO DITCH IN THE GULF. AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT, AIR LOGISTICS HAS INITIATED A PROGRAM REQUIRING THAT EACH PILOT BE PROVIDED A LIFEJACKET EQUIPPED WITH A 406-MEGAHERTZ EMERGENCY POSITION INDICATING RADIO BEACON THAT HAS FULL TWO-WAY VOICE CAPABILITY AND THAT IS WATERPROOF TO 10 METERS. THIS PROGRAM REQUIREMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THE RECOMMENDATION EVEN WITHOUT THE FAA REQUIRING IT.

ADDITIONALLY, PERSONAL LOCATOR BEACONS (WITHOUT TWO-WAY VOICE CAPABILITY) HAVE BEEN INSTALLED IN AIR LOGISTICS LIFERAFTS. AIR LOGISTICS ALSO HAS STARTED INSTALLING WATER-ACTIVATED SWITCHES ON THE FLOTATION SYSTEM AND LIFERAFTS FOR ITS BELL 407 HELICOPTERS; THE SWITCHES ARE BEING INSTALLED DURING EACH HELICOPTER’S NEXT MAINTENANCE OR INSPECTION VISIT. PLACARDS HAVE ALSO BEEN PLACED ON THE UNDERSIDE OF AIRCRAFT SHOWING THE MECHANISM FOR MANUAL DEPLOYMENT OF LIFERAFTS WHEN THE AIRCRAFT IS UPSIDE DOWN IN THE WATER. TO STANDARDIZE THE BRIEFING INFORMATION GIVEN TO PASSENGERS, THE PREFLIGHT BRIEFING CHECKLIST, PASSENGER BRIEFING CARDS, AND PASSENGER BRIEFING TAPES HAVE BEEN REVISED TO INCLUDE INFORMATION ON THE LOCATION AND OPERATION OF LIFERAFTS.
IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PRODUCED AN INITIAL AND RECURRENT TRAINING VIDEO TO INCLUDE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON HOW TO DEPLOY THE FLOTATION SYSTEM AND LIFERAFTS INSTALLED ON ITS HELICOPTERS, INCLUDING FOOTAGE OF AN ACTUAL DEPLOYMENT, AND HAS REVAMPED ITS AIRCRAFT TYPE-SPECIFIC BRIEFING VIDEOS FOR PASSENGERS. THE TRAINING AND BRIEFING VIDEOS ARE SHOWN TO ALL FIRST-TIME PASSENGERS BEFORE THEY DEPART THEIR SHORE BASE. AIR LOGISTICS ALSO HAS A SEPARATE VIDEO SPECIFICALLY ON RAFT AND FLOAT DEPLOYMENT, WHICH INCLUDES MANUAL DEPLOYMENT FROM OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT; ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY, THIS VIDEO USUALLY RUNS CONTINUALLY IN THE WAITING ROOMS AT THE SHORE BASE. THUS FAR, AIR LOGISTICS PILOTS AND PASSENGERS HAVE GIVEN POSITIVE FEEDBACK ON THE TRAINING AND BRIEFING VIDEOS.

TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF MISREPORTING HELICOPTER STATUS, A SENIOR COMPANY PILOT NOW ASSISTS THE RADIO OPERATOR WITH OVERSIGHT OF HELICOPTERS, AND HELICOPTER PILOTS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE POSITION REPORTS EVERY 30 MINUTES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEIR HELICOPTER IS AIRBORNE OR HAS LANDED. THE RADIO OPERATOR AND THE SENIOR PILOT MONITOR ANY PILOT WHO REQUESTS A LONGER DELAY TO EAT LUNCH OR TAKE A RESTROOM BREAK, FOR EXAMPLE. ALSO, TO ELIMINATE INADVERTENT CHANGES IN HELICOPTER STATUS, AN ADDITIONAL KEYSTROKE HAS BEEN ADDED TO CONFIRM THAT A HELICOPTER HAS LANDED.","THE PILOT’S DECISION TO CONTINUE TO THE DESTINATION LANDING PLATFORM IN WEATHER CONDITIONS BELOW THE COMPANY’S WEATHER MINIMUMS AND HIS FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AIRCRAFT CONTROL DURING THE APPROACH. CONTRIBUTING TO THE PASSENGER FATALITY AND THE SEVERITY OF THE OCCUPANT INJURIES WERE THE LACK OF A PASSENGER BRIEFING ON HOW TO DEPLOY THE LIFERAFT, WHICH WAS REQUIRED BY THE COMPANY BUT NOT BY THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THIS FLIGHT WAS NOT AN EXTENDED OVERWATER OPERATION; THE PILOT’S FAILURE TO DEPLOY THE LIFERAFTS; AND THE COMPANY RADIO OPERATOR’S MISREPORTING OF THE HELICOPTER’S “LANDED” STATUS, WHICH DELAYED THE RESCUE RESPONSE."

ON MARCH 13, 2008, AT 0940 EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME, A ROBINSON R22 BETA II, N2215R, WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED DURING A FORCED LANDING IN WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA. THE CERTIFICATED COMMERCIAL PILOT WAS FATALLY INJURED. DAY VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED, AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE LOCAL FLIGHT WHICH DEPARTED WILMINGTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (ILM), WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA. THE PERSONAL FLIGHT WAS CONDUCTED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF TITLE 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS PART 91.

ACCORDING TO AIRPORT PERSONNEL, THE PILOT WAS PLANNING TO FLY SOUTH IN ORDER TO TAKE AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS OF A BUSINESS AND THEN PROCEED TO ANOTHER LOCATION TO PICK UP A STUDENT FOR A TRAINING LESSON. 

A WITNESS, LOCATED ABOUT 1/2 MILE FROM THE ACCIDENT SCENE, OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER WHEN IT PASSED OVERHEAD, AND NOTED THAT ""THE ENGINE WAS SPITTING AND SPUTTERING."" THE WITNESS ALSO NOTED THAT THE HELICOPTER APPEARED TO BE ""ABOUT 50 FEET ABOVE THE PINE TREES,"" WHICH WERE ESTIMATED TO BE 150 FEET IN HEIGHT. ANOTHER WITNESS STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER APPEARED TO BE ""JUST ABOVE THE TOP OF A BILLBOARD SIGN"" WHEN SHE FIRST NOTICED IT. SHE STATED THAT SHE ""SAW PARTS SHEDDING TO THE SOUTH THEN [IT] STARTED TO REVERSE DIRECTION."" THE WITNESS THEN LOST SIGHT OF THE HELICOPTER BEHIND THE ROOF OF A BUILDING AND OBSERVED SMOKE.  ACCORDING TO ANOTHER WITNESS, HE SAW THE HELICOPTER AS ""PARTS BEGAN TO FALL OFF,"" IT IMPACTED THE GROUND, THEN ""BLEW UP INTO FLAMES.""

THERE WAS NO RADAR TRACK OF THE HELICOPTER, AND NO ONBOARD RECORDING DEVICES WERE LOCATED.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED THE GROUND IN AN OPEN LOT APPROXIMATELY 3 FEET FROM SEVERAL STORAGE TRAILERS. THE HELICOPTER EXHIBITED IMPACT DAMAGE AND POST-IMPACT FIRE DAMAGE. THE DEBRIS PATH WAS ON A HEADING OF 342 DEGREES AND THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST HEADING ABOUT 140 DEGREES. THE MAIN WRECKAGE CONSISTED OF THE FUSELAGE, MAIN ROTOR ASSEMBLY, TAIL BOOM, AND TAIL ROTOR. THE TAIL CONE WAS SEPARATED FROM THE FUSELAGE AT A RIGHT ANGLE AND NO LEADING EDGE DAMAGE WAS FOUND ON THE TAIL ROTOR BLADES.  SEVERAL PIECES OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE, THE EMPENNAGE, AND THE HELICOPTER ANTI-COLLISION BEACON WERE COLLOCATED APPROXIMATELY 350 FEET SOUTH OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE. THE WRECKAGE WAS EXAMINED AT THE ACCIDENT SITE AND THEN RECOVERED TO A SECURE FACILITY AT ILM FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION.

EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER REVEALED SPANWISE CONING OF THE TWO MAIN ROTOR BLADES. ONE OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WAS MISSING A SECTION OF THE TRAILING EDGE, APPROXIMATELY 6 INCHES CHORDWISE BY 40 INCHES SPANWISE, STARTING ABOUT 26 INCHES FROM THE BLADE HUB. THE OTHER MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS MISSING A SECTION OF THE TRAILING EDGE, APPROXIMATELY 6 INCHES CHORDWISE BY 61 INCHES SPANWISE, STARTING ABOUT 24 INCHES FROM THE BLADE HUB. ONE OF THE SEPARATED MAIN ROTOR BLADE SECTIONS EXHIBITED AN IMPRESSION, CONSISTENT IN SHAPE, TO THE LEADING EDGE OF THE VERTICAL STABILIZER. 

THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM WAS ROTATED THROUGH THE MAIN GEAR BOX WITHOUT BINDING. THE DRIVE BELTS BETWEEN THE ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION WERE NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE BURNT WRECKAGE. 

THE EMPENNAGE, CONSISTING OF THE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL STABILIZER, WAS DETACHED FROM THE AFT BULKHEAD OF THE TAILCONE. 

THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT FORWARD FLEX PLATE EXHIBITED ROTATIONAL DISTORTION AND CRUMPLING, AND WAS SEPARATED FROM BOTH CONNECTING YOKES. THE AFT FLEX PLATE WAS NOT DAMAGED.

THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT DAMPER BEARING ASSEMBLY, WHICH CONSISTED OF A HOUSING, AN INNER AND OUTER RACE, AND BEARINGS, WAS DAMAGED. THE DAMPER BEARING INNER RACE WAS IN PLACE ON THE DRIVE SHAFT AND WAS ABLE TO ROTATE IN PLACE. THE OUTER RACE AND BEARINGS WERE SEPARATED AND COULD NOT BE LOCATED. THE BEARING HOUSING REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE ARM. IT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED IF THE DAMPER ASSEMBLY OPERATED AS INTENDED PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT SEQUENCE. 

THE INTERIOR OF THE TAIL CONE, IN THE VICINITY OF THE FORWARD FLEX PLATE, DISPLAYED ROTATIONAL SCORING AROUND THE ENTIRE CIRCUMFERENCE. THE ELECTRICAL WIRES HAD BEEN PULLED THROUGH THE GROMMETS AND THE PUSH/PULL TUBE WAS WRAPPED AROUND THE DRIVE SHAFT.

THE TAIL ROTOR GEAR BOX ROTATED SMOOTHLY, AND THE PITCH CONTROL BELL CRANK SUPPORT WAS SEPARATED FROM THE GEARBOX.

THE ENGINE CRANKSHAFT WAS ROTATED USING THE COOLING FAN, AND CONTINUITY OF THE CRANKSHAFT TO THE REAR GEARS AND TO THE VALVE TRAIN WAS CONFIRMED. THUMB COMPRESSION AND SUCTION WAS PRODUCED ON CYLINDERS 1, 3, AND 4. CYLINDER 2 PRODUCED MINIMAL COMPRESSION AND FURTHER EXAMINATION REVEALED THE INTAKE VALVE SPRINGS WERE COMPRESSED TO A HEIGHT OF 1.4 TO 1.5 INCHES BUT WERE UNBROKEN. BOTH THE INNER AND OUTER SPRINGS WERE DISCOLORED CONSISTENT WITH THERMAL DAMAGE. CYLINDER 2 WAS REMOVED FROM THE CRANKCASE AND NO DAMAGE WAS NOTED TO THE INTAKE OR EXHAUST VALVES, CYLINDER WALL, PISTON, OR CONNECTING ROD. THE INTERIOR OF ALL CYLINDERS WERE INSPECTED USING A LIGHTED BOROSCOPE; NO ANOMALIES WERE FOUND. THE CARBURETOR BOWL WAS SEPARATED FROM ITS UPPER HOUSING AND WAS APPROXIMATELY 2 FEET FROM THE FRONT OF THE ENGINE. THE MAIN FUEL NOZZLE WAS BROKEN OFF AND THE FUEL LINES WERE SEPARATED. THE MIXTURE CONTROL CABLE WAS DETACHED BUT WAS IN THE FULL RICH MIXTURE POSITION. THE THROTTLE CONTROL ROD REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE THROTTLE CONTROL ARM BUT WAS SEPARATED FROM THE THROTTLE CONTROL FORWARD OF THE FIREWALL. THE THROTTLE PLATE WAS FOUND ABOUT 3/4 FULLY OPEN. THE SPARK PLUGS WERE DARK GRAY IN COLOR AND THE ELECTRODES WERE INTACT. THE CARBURETOR FUEL INLET SCREEN EXHIBITED THERMAL DAMAGE, BUT WAS ABSENT OF DEBRIS. THE OIL COOLER AND HOSES WERE DAMAGED, BUT OIL WAS VISIBLE THROUGHOUT THE ENGINE. THE ENGINE OIL FILTER PAPER ELEMENT WAS CHARRED. NO METALLIC DEBRIS WAS NOTED ON THE OIL FILTER ELEMENT OR THE OIL SUCTION SCREEN. THE MAGNETOS HAD THERMAL DAMAGE AND WERE UNABLE TO BE TESTED.

ALTHOUGH FIRE-DAMAGED, EXAMINATION OF THE INSTRUMENT PANEL REVEALED THAT THE ENGINE RPM NEEDLE WAS IN THE APPROXIMATE UPPER LIMIT POSITION AND THE ROTOR RPM NEEDLE WAS IN THE APPROXIMATE LOWER LIMIT POSITION; HOWEVER, IT WAS UNABLE TO BE DETERMINED IF THOSE WERE THE INDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. THE IGNITION KEY POSITION WAS UNABLE TO BE DETERMINED DUE TO THERMAL AND IMPACT DAMAGE. 

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

A POSTMORTEM EXAMINATION OF THE PILOT WAS PERFORMED ON MARCH 14, 2008 AT COASTAL PATHOLOGY ASSOCIATES, P.A., JACKSONVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA, WITH THE CAUSE OF DEATH DETERMINED TO BE ""MASSIVE BLUNT TRAUMA."" 

TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING WAS PERFORMED POST MORTEM AT THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) BIOAERONAUTICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH LABORATORY, OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA WITH NO ANOMALIES NOTED.

TESTS AND RESEARCH

PUSH-PULL TUBE AND CLUTCH ASSEMBLY MATERIALS EXAMINATION

THE NTSB MATERIALS LABORATORY EXAMINED THE INTERMEDIATE FLEX PLATE, A PORTION OF THE PUSH-PULL TUBE, A PORTION OF THE MAIN TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT, AND THE BEARING ASSEMBLY HOUSING. ALL FRACTURED SURFACES WERE CONSISTENT WITH OVERSTRESS SEPARATION AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT. THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF ANY MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS.

ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY “SAFETY NOTICE (SN-34), AERIAL SURVEY AND PHOTO FLIGHTS – VERY HIGH RISK,” STATES, IN PART, ""AERIAL SURVEY AND PHOTO FLIGHTS SHOULD ONLY BE CONDUCTED BY WELL TRAINED, EXPERIENCED PILOTS WHO:

1) HAVE AT LEAST 500 HOURS PILOT-IN-COMMAND IN HELICOPTERS AND OVER 100 HOURS IN THE MODEL FLOWN;
2) HAVE EXTENSIVE TRAINING IN BOTH LOW RPM AND SETTLING-WITH-POWER RECOVERY TECHNIQUES;
3) ARE WILLING TO SAY NO TO THE OBSERVER OR PHOTOGRAPHER AND ONLY FLY THE AIRCRAFT AT SPEEDS, ALTITUDE, AND WIND ANGLES THAT ARE SAFE AND ALLOW GOOD ESCAPE ROUTES.""

ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY “SAFETY NOTICE (SN-36), OVERSPEEDS DURING LIFTOFF,” STATES, IN PART, ""…OVERSPEEDS CAUSED A TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT VIBRATION WHICH LED TO IMMEDIATE FAILURE OF SHAFT AND TAILCONE… DAMPER IS NOT EFFECTIVE ABOVE 120% RPM.""

ACCORDING TO TESTING DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED BY A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER, “WHIRL” MODES (WHICH CAN RESULT IN HARMONIC OSCILLATION OF THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT AND CAN LEAD TO SHAFT DISTORTION) ON THE R22 OCCUR AT THE FOLLOWING ENGINE RPM:

1ST - 15.2 % MAIN ROTOR RPM
2ND - 60.6% MAIN ROTOR RPM
3RD – 132.0 % MAIN ROTOR RPM

ACCORDING TO A REPRESENTATIVE OF ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY, THE FIRST TWO WHIRL MODES WOULD NOT OCCUR IN FLIGHT AS THEY ARE BELOW THE NORMAL MAIN ROTOR RPM OPERATING RANGE. THE THIRD WHIRL MODE COULD OCCUR IF AN OVERSPEED OCCURS; THE MANUFACTURER'S MAXIMUM OPERATING MAIN ROTOR RPM LIMITATION IS 102%. 

FAA PUBLICATION P-8740-24, ""TIPS ON WINTER FLYING,"" DISCUSSES CARBURETOR ICING AND SOME OF THE HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. THE PUBLICATION STATES, IN PART, ""IN GENERAL, CARBURETOR ICE WILL FORM IN TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 32-80 DEGREES F WHEN THE RELATIVE HUMIDITY IS 50 PERCENT OR MORE. IF VISIBLE MOISTURE IS PRESENT, IT WILL FORM AT TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 15 -32 DEGREES F."" IN ORDER TO COUNTERACT CARBURETOR ICING, THE PILOT SHOULD APPLY FULL CARBURETOR HEAT IMMEDIATELY. THE PUBLICATION ALSO NOTED THAT THE ENGINE ""MAY RUN ROUGH INITIALLY FOR A SHORT TIME WHILE ICE MELTS.""

INTERPOLATION OF A CARBURETOR ICING PROBABILITY CHART CONTAINED WITHIN THE PUBLICATION REVEALED THAT THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS WERE CONDUCIVE TO ""SERIOUS ICING"" AT GLIDE POWER.

THE HELICOPTER WAS CONFIGURED WITH A CARBURETOR HEAT ASSIST DEVICE. THE DEVICE WAS DESIGNED TO ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF CARBURETOR HEAT APPLIED BASED UPON MOVEMENT OF THE COLLECTIVE. LOWERING THE COLLECTIVE WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CARBURETOR HEAT FROM THE LEVEL PRESELECTED BY THE PILOT, AND RAISING THE COLLECTIVE WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CARBURETOR HEAT. 

THE CARBURETOR HEAT KNOB COULD BE LOCKED IN THE OFF POSITION, RENDERING THE CARBURETOR HEAT ASSIST DEVICE INOPERATIVE. PRIOR TO TAKEOFF, WITH THE ROTOR AT AN RPM OF 100 PERCENT THE PILOT WOULD SELECT AN AMOUNT OF CARBURETOR HEAT APPLICATION THAT WOULD PLACE THE INDICATOR NEEDLE ABOVE THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE YELLOW ARC OF THE CARBURETOR AIR TEMPERATURE (CAT) GAUGE. IT WOULD STILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PILOT TO MONITOR THE CAT GAUGE AND TO SELECT AN AMOUNT OF CARBURETOR HEAT THAT WOULD KEEP THE CAT GAUGE NEEDLE OUT OF THE YELLOW ARC. THE CAT GAUGE HAD BEEN REPORTED AS INOPERATIVE PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT.

PUBLISHED EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

THE FAA-APPROVED FLIGHT MANUAL, IN THE EMERGENCY PROCEDURES SECTION, ""POWER FAILURE-GENERAL,"" STATES, IN PART, ""PILOTS REQUIRED EMERGENCY ACTION IS:

1.	LOWER COLLECTIVE IMMEDIATELY TO MAINTAIN ROTOR RPM, AND ENTER NORMAL AUTOROTATION.
2.	ESTABLISH A STEADY GLIDE AT APPROXIMATELY 65 KNOTS.
3.	ADJUST COLLECTIVE TO KEEP ROTOR RPM IN THE GREEN ARC, OR, FULL DOWN IF LIGHTWEIGHT PREVENTS ATTAINING 97% ROTOR RPM.
4.

ANOTHER WITNESS SAW PARTS “SHEDDING” FROM THE HELICOPTER, THEN SAW IT REVERSE DIRECTION AND DESCEND UNTIL SHE LOST SIGHT OF IT BEHIND A BUILDING. THE HELICOPTER SUBSEQUENTLY IMPACTED THE GROUND IN A VACANT LOT AND ERUPTED INTO FLAMES. A POSTFLIGHT EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED NO MECHANICAL ANOMALIES. THE CARBURETOR AIR TEMPERATURE GAUGE WAS REPORTED TO BE INOPERATIVE AND INTERPOLATION OF A CARBURETOR ICING PROBABILITY CHART REVEALED ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO ""SERIOUS ICING"" AT GLIDE POWER. HOWEVER, THE POSITION OF THE CARBURETOR HEAT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED AND THE INVESTIGATION COULD NOT ESTABLISH THE ROLE THAT CARBURETOR ICING MAY HAVE PLAYED IN THE ACCIDENT. AN EXAMINATION OF THE TWO MAIN ROTOR BLADES REVEALED THAT EACH HAD A SECTION MISSING, BEGINNING ABOUT EQUIDISTANT FROM THE ROTOR HUB. BOTH SECTIONS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY LOCATED AWAY FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE. BOTH MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE ALSO CONED UPWARDS FROM THE HUB, WHICH, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MISSING BLADE SECTIONS, WAS CONSISTENT WITH A LOW ROTOR RPM CONDITION. AN EXAMINATION OF THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVESHAFT, AND THE PUSH-PULL TUBE RUNNING ALONG IT, REVEALED THAT THEY HAD BECOME ENTWINED, CONSISTENT WITH A “WHIRL” CONDITION. ACCORDING TO A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MANUFACTURER, SUCH A WHIRL MODE COULD OCCUR IF AN OVERSPEED OCCURS; THE MANUFACTURER'S MAXIMUM OPERATING MAIN ROTOR RPM LIMITATION IS 102%. THE EVENT LIKELY BEGAN WITH A PARTIAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER, FOLLOWED BY THE PILOT’S DELAYED RESPONSE TO A LOW ROTOR RPM CONDITION, WHICH THEN RESULTED IN THE CONING OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES AND A LOSS OF MAIN ROTOR BLADE MATERIAL.",THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PROPER ROTOR RPM AFTER A PARTIAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER.

ON MAY 25, 2008, AT 1921 CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME, A MCDONNELL DOUGLAS HELICOPTER COMPANY MD 500E/369E, N686F, OPERATED BY A COMMERCIAL PILOT, IMPACTED THE WATER WHILE ATTEMPTING TO LAND AT A PRIVATE HELIPAD AT LAKE OF THE OZARKS, SUNRISE BEACH, MISSOURI. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. THE PERSONAL FLIGHT WAS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF TITLE 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS PART 91 WITHOUT A FLIGHT PLAN. THE PILOT AND TWO PASSENGERS REPORTED NO INJURIES; ONE PASSENGER SUSTAINED SERIOUS INJURIES, AND ONE PASSENGER WAS FATALLY INJURED. THE LOCAL FLIGHT DEPARTED AT 1917.

ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, THE SHORT HELICOPTER RIDE WAS PLANNED TO FLY THE NEIGHBOR'S CHILDREN, HIS SON, AND HIS SON'S FRIEND AROUND THE LAKE. THE FLIGHT DEPARTED THE PILOT'S RESIDENCE, PROCEEDED ""ACROSS THE NORTH RIDGE OF THE LAKE,"" AND THEN REVERSED COURSE TO PROCEED BACK TOWARDS THE PILOT'S RESIDENCE. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT DURING APPROACH FOR LANDING HE INITIATED A TURN TOWARDS THE EAST AND WITHIN A ""FEW SECOND AT AN ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 35 FEET, THE HELICOPTER BEGAN TO SPIN RAPIDLY TO THE RIGHT."" THE PILOT STATED THAT HE ""APPLIED FULL OPPOSITE DIRECTION ANTI-TORQUE PEDAL AND A SLIGHT REDUCTION IN COLLECTIVE."" HE REPORTED THAT THE ROTATION ""INCREASED AND BECAME MORE VIOLENT."" THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED THE WATER AND SANK. PRIOR TO THE SPINNING, THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS OR SOUNDS.

ACCORDING TO THE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER, THE FLIGHT WAS SHORT, APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES IN DURATION. SHE HAD NOT FLOWN IN A HELICOPTER BEFORE AND COMMENTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS ""ROCKING"" AND DID NOT KNOW IF THIS WAS NORMAL. JUST PRIOR TO LANDING THE HELICOPTER WAS ""HOVERING OR SITTING STILL."" THE HELICOPTER SPUN AROUND ONCE, PAUSED, SPUN AROUND AGAIN REALLY FAST, AND EVENTUALLY IMPACTED THE WATER. THE REAR SEAT PASSENGER REPORTED THAT THE ""TAIL"" OF THE HELICOPTER STRUCK THE WATER FIRST.

THE MISSOURI STATE WATER PATROL TOOK WITNESS STATEMENTS FROM TWELVE INDIVIDUALS. THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (SAFETY BOARD) INVESTIGATOR IN CHARGE (IIC) INTERVIEWED TWO WITNESSES AND RECEIVED FOUR ADDITIONAL WITNESS STATEMENTS. ACCORDING TO THESE WITNESSES THE HELICOPTER APPROACHED THE LANDING ZONE FROM THE NORTH AND MADE SEVERAL TURNS, AS IF MANEUVERING TO LAND. THE HELICOPTER TURNED TOWARDS THE EAST AND SLOWED TO A HOVER. ONE WITNESS REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER MADE A ""VERY QUICK 90-DEGREE TURN."" THE HELICOPTER THEN ROTATED AROUND, STOPPING ON AN APPROXIMATE HEADING OF EAST AS IT IMPACTED THE WATER. MULTIPLE WITNESSES REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS SPINNING AROUND TO THE RIGHT, MULTIPLE TIMES, AT A VERY HIGH SPEED. THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED THE WATER AND SANK VERY QUICKLY.

ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT THE SKY WAS CLEAR, THERE WAS NO TURBULENCE, AND HE ESTIMATED THE WIND SPEED AT EIGHT KNOTS. HE STATED HE WAS USING SMOKE IN THE AREA AND A FLAG NEAR HIS RESIDENCE TO DETERMINE WIND SPEED AND DIRECTION. THE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER STATED THAT THE SKY WAS DARK TOWARDS THE ""HOUSE"" AND SHE OBSERVED LIGHTNING IN THAT DIRECTION. SHE REPORTED THAT THE WINDS WERE CALM, AND THEN THEY WOULD ""PICK UP."" DURING THE FLIGHT THE PILOT COMMENTED TO HER ABOUT THE ""INCREDIBLE WINDS."" MULTIPLE WITNESSES TO THE ACCIDENT REPORTED STRONG, GUSTY SURFACE WINDS AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.

THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE LOCATED INDICATING THAT THE PILOT OBTAINED A WEATHER BRIEFING FROM EITHER THE FLIGHT SERVICE STATION OR DIRECT USER ACCESS TERMINAL SYSTEMS (DUATS). THE PILOT REPORTED ON HIS ACCIDENT REPORT FORM THAT HE OBTAINED WEATHER INFORMATION FROM THE INTERNET.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER WRECKAGE WAS LOCATED IN 35 TO 40 FEET OF WATER IN LAKE OF THE OZARKS. THE TERRAIN SURROUNDING THE ACCIDENT LOCATION AND LANDING ZONE WAS HILLY, VEGETATED WITH TALL DECIDUOUS TREES, AND MULTI-LEVEL HOMES. ACCORDING TO THE MISSOURI STATE WATER PATROL, THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST ON ITS LEFT SIDE IN THE WATER. THE HELICOPTER WAS RECOVERED FROM THE WATER ON MAY 26, 2008, AND RELOCATED TO A MISSOURI STATE WATER PATROL STORAGE FACILITY FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION.  

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

IN ACCORDANCE WITH MISSOURI STATE LAW A BLOOD SPECIMENS WAS COLLECTED FOR TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING. THIS SPECIMEN WAS COLLECTED WITHIN AN HOUR OF THE ACCIDENT. TESTING WAS PERFORMED BY THE FAA'S CIVIL AEROSPACE MEDICAL INSTITUTE, OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA (CAMI REFERENCE #200800106001). CARBON MONOXIDE AND CYANIDE TESTS WERE NOT PERFORMED. NO ETHANOL WAS DETECTED. DIPHENHYDRAMINE (0.022 UG/ML) AND BUTALBITAL (0.077 UG/ML) WERE DETECTED IN THE BLOOD.

A REVIEW OF THE PILOT'S MEDICAL RECORDS, MAINTAINED BY THE FAA AEROSPACE MEDICAL CERTIFICATION DIVISION, WAS CONDUCTED BY THE SAFETY BOARD MEDICAL OFFICER. THE RECORDS DOCUMENTED THAT THE PILOT HAD A HISTORY OF DIABETES DIAGNOSED IN 1993 AND CONTROLLED WITH DIET ALONE AT THAT TIME. SUBSEQUENT APPLICATIONS BEGINNING FEBRUARY 3, 1998, SPECIFICALLY INDICATED NO HISTORY OF DIABETES, AND NO GLUCOSE OR PROTEIN WAS NOTED ON URINALYSIS ON ANY OF THOSE APPLICATIONS. ON JUNE 6, 1998, A LETTER TO THE PILOT FROM THE MANAGER OF THE FAA AEROMEDICAL CERTIFICATION DIVISION INDICATED IN PART THAT THE PILOT WAS ELIGIBLE FOR A THIRD CLASS MEDICAL CERTIFICATE AND THAT DUE TO THE PILOT'S ""HISTORY OF DIABETES, OPERATION OF AIRCRAFT IS PROHIBITED AT ANY TIME NEW SYMPTOMS OR ADVERSE CHANGES OCCUR OR ANY TIME MEDICATION IS REQUIRED.""

FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT, THE PILOT WAS QUESTIONED BY THE SAFETY BOARD IIC ABOUT THE USE OF ANY MEDICATION PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT, TO WHICH HE RESPONDED THAT HE HAD NOT TAKEN ANY. WHEN PRESENTED WITH THE TOXICOLOGY RESULTS, HE RESPONDED HE COULD NOT RECALL WHAT HE HAD TAKEN. A LETTER FROM THE PILOT TO AN FAA REGIONAL FLIGHT SURGEON DATED SEPTEMBER 11, 2008 STATED IN PART THAT A FAMILY MEMBER HAD PROVIDED THE PILOT WITH A PILL FROM HER ""BUTALBITAL PRESCRIPTION"" WHEN THE PILOT HAD ASKED FOR AN ASPIRIN FOR A MILD HEADACHE MORE THAN 24 HOURS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. THE LETTER ALSO STATED THAT THE PILOT HAD TAKEN AN OVER THE COUNTER DIPHENHYDRAMINE THE DAY PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.

SURVIVAL ASPECTS

ACCORDING TO THE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER, THIS WAS HER FIRST FLIGHT IN A HELICOPTER. SHE WAS SITTING IN THE FRONT RIGHT SEAT AND THE THREE BOYS WERE IN THE BACK. THE PILOT FASTENED HER SEATBELT AND CLOSED THE DOOR. SHE WAS NOT SHOWN HOW TO OPERATE THE DOOR OR HOW TO FASTEN/UNFASTEN HER SEATBELT. AFTER THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED THE WATER, SHE FELT SOMETHING HITTING HER IN THE HEAD. SHE WAS ""ABOUT TO PASS OUT"" WHEN SHE GOT HER SEATBELT UNLATCHED. SHE WAS UNABLE TO RECALL HOW SHE EXITED THE HELICOPTER.

THE REAR LEFT SEAT PASSENGER REPORTED THAT HE FASTENED HIS OWN SEATBELT, WHICH WAS LATER CHECKED BY THE PILOT. HE HAD FLOWN WITH THE PILOT ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS. HE STATED THAT HIS FRIEND WAS SITTING IN THE REAR RIGHT SEAT AND WAS SHARING A SEATBELT WITH THE FATAL VICTIM. AFTER THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED THE WATER, HE WAS ABLE TO TAKE HIS SEATBELT ""RIGHT OFF"" KNEED OUT THE WINDOW, AND WAS ABLE TO GET OUT QUICKLY. HE STATED THAT THE TAIL WAS STILL ABOVE THE WATER WHEN HE CAME TO THE SURFACE.

THE REAR RIGHT SEAT PASSENGER REPORTED THAT HE HAD FLOWN WITH THE PILOT (HIS FATHER) ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS. HE FASTENED THE SEATBELT AROUND HIMSELF AND THE FATAL VICTIM. AFTER THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED THE WATER, HE UNBUCKLED THE SEATBELT AND WENT TO AN ""AIR BUBBLE"" UNDER THE WATER WITH THE VICTIM. HE OBTAINED A ""QUICK BREATH"" AND THEN EXITED THE HELICOPTER FROM THE LEFT DOOR. HE STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS NOT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE WHEN HE EXITED. THE DOOR WAS ALREADY OPEN; HE DID NOT HAVE TO OPEN IT.

THE PILOT STATED THAT HE RECALLED HELPING HIS FRONT SEAT PASSENGER UNBUCKLE HER SEAT HARNESS AFTER THE HELICOPTER WAS SUBMERGED IN WATER. HE COULD NOT RECALL HOW HE EGRESSED OUT OF THE HELICOPTER.

ACCORDING TO FAMILY MEMBERS THE FATAL VICTIM HAD NEVER FLOWN IN A HELICOPTER PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT.

THE HELICOPTER WAS NOT EQUIPPED WITH NOR REQUIRED TO BE EQUIPPED WITH PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICES.

TESTS AND RESEARCH

ON MAY 27 AND 28, 2008, THE WRECKAGE WAS EXAMINED BY THE SAFETY BOARD IIC, INVESTIGATORS FROM BOEING, MD HELICOPTERS (FORMERLY MCDONNELL DOUGLAS), ROLLS ROYCE, AND INSPECTORS FROM THE FAA.

THE MAIN WRECKAGE THAT WAS RECOVERED INCLUDED THE FUSELAGE, AND EMPENNAGE. THE FIVE MAIN ROTOR BLADES SEPARATED AND WERE NOT RECOVERED FROM THE LAKE. THE FUSELAGE, TO INCLUDE THE LANDING SKIDS, FOUR DOORS, FLIGHT CONTROLS, AND INSTRUMENT PANEL, WAS WATER LOGGED IN MOST INTERNAL AREAS AND WAS MUDDY. THE UPPER LEFT AND RIGHT, AND LOWER RIGHT WINDSCREENS WERE PARTIALLY FRAGMENTED. THE WINDSCREENS ON THE FRONT AND AFT CABIN DOORS ON THE LEFT SIDE WERE MISSING. THE SKIN ON THE AFT LEFT DOOR WAS WRINKLED. THE DOORS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CABIN WERE UNREMARKABLE. 

THE FORWARD CABIN INCLUDED THE PILOT SEAT, FRONT PASSENGER SEAT, TWO SETS OF SEATBELT/SHOULDER HARNESS ASSEMBLIES, TWO SETS OF FLIGHT CONTROLS, AND A CENTER MOUNTED INSTRUMENT PANEL. BOTH SEAT BELTS WERE UNLATCHED BUT REMAINED ATTACHED AT THEIR DESIGN MOUNTING POINTS. THE INERTIAL REELS ON BOTH SIDES LOCKED WHEN FORWARD OR DOWN FORCES WERE APPLIED. 

THE FOLLOWING INDICATIONS WERE OBSERVED ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL:

AIRSPEED INDICATOR - 72 KNOTS
ATTITUDE INDICATOR - 28 DEGREES LEFT BANK, NOSE DOWN
ALTIMETER - 366 FEET
KOLLSMAN WINDOW - 29.77 INCHES
VERTICAL SPEED INDICATOR - 3,000 FEET PER MINUTE DESCENT
HEADING INDICATOR - 342 DEGREES

ROTOR RPM - ZERO
ENGINE TORQUE - ZERO
N1 - ZERO
OIL PRESSURE - ZERO TO ONE PERCENT

THE ENGINE AND FLIGHT CONTROLS WERE OBSERVED IN THE FOLLOWING POSITIONS:

COLLECTIVE - UP
THROTTLE - FLIGHT IDLE
FUEL KNOB - IN

CONTROL CONTINUITY FROM THE CYCLIC AND COLLECTIVE WAS CONTINUOUS TO THE MAIN ROTOR AND THE ANTI-TORQUE PEDALS AFT TO THE TAIL ROTOR. 

THE AFT CABIN INCLUDED TWO SEATS, TWO SETS OF SEATBELT/SHOULD HARNESS ASSEMBLIES, A START PACK, AND A SURVIVAL KIT. THE SEAT BELTS WERE UNLATCHED AND REMAINED ATTACHED AT THEIR DESIGNED MOUNTING POINTS. THE INERTIAL REELS LOCKED WHEN FORWARD OR DOWN FORCES WERE APPLIED.

THE ENGINE REMAINED ATTACHED IN ITS AFT MOUNTED LOCATION. THE SURROUNDING COWLING WAS BENT AND WRINKLED. THE COMPRESSOR SECTION (N1) ROTATED FREELY BY HAND. THE EXHAUST STACKS WERE REMOVED AND THE TURBINE SECTION (N2) ROTATED FREELY BY HAND. THE ENGINE TO TRANSMISSION CONNECTION WAS CONTINUOUS. FUEL CONTROL CONTINUITY WAS CONFIRMED.

THE TAIL BOOM REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE FUSELAGE. THE BOTTOM OF THE TAIL BOOM WAS BUCKLED 45 INCHES FORWARD OF THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX ATTACH POINT. THE GEARBOX MOVED FREELY WHEN ACTIVATED BY HAND WITHOUT ANY GRINDING OR BINDING. BOTH TAIL ROTOR BLADES REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE GEARBOX. THE TAIL ROTOR FORK BOLT WAS BROKEN AND THE HEAD WAS MISSING. THE TAIL ROTOR BLADES WERE ARBITRARILY LABELED ""A"" AND ""B"" FOR IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES ONLY. BLADE A EXHIBITED A SLIGHT BEND SEVEN INCHES OUTBOARD FROM THE HUB ON THE TRAILING EDGE. BLADE B EXHIBITED A SLIGHT BEND THREE INCHES OUTBOARD FROM THE HUB.

THE TRANSMISSION TO TAIL ROTOR CONNECTION WAS NOT CONTINUOUS. INSPECTION PANELS WERE REMOVED AND REVEALED THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT SEPARATED TOWARDS THE FUSELAGE. THE GEARBOX WAS REMOVED AND REMAINED ATTACHED TO NINE FEET OF THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVESHAFT. THE POINT OF SEPARATION EXHIBITED TWISTING AND COLLAPSING OF THE TUBE. A DENT WAS OBSERVED 35.25 INCHES FORWARD FROM THE AFT END OF THE SHAFT. ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES OF ROTATIONAL SCORING WAS OBSERVED OPPOSITE THE DENT IN THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVESHAFT. ADDITIONAL 180 DEGREE ROTATION SCORING WAS NOTED 41.5 INCHES INBOARD OF THE AFT END OF THE SHAFT.

THE FORWARD END OF THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVESHAFT WAS 52 INCHES IN LENGTH AND EXHIBITED TWISTING AND COLLAPSING AT THE POINT OF SEPARATION. EXTENSIVE ROTATIONAL SCORING WAS NOTED 18 TO 19 INCHES AFT FROM THE ATTACH POINT. 

THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVESHAFT AND HUB WE","ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, HE WAS APPROACHING HIS PERSONAL HELIPAD WHEN THE HELICOPTER STARTED ROTATING RAPIDLY TO THE RIGHT. MULTIPLE WITNESSES REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER APPROACHED THE LANDING ZONE FROM THE NORTH AND MANEUVERED TO LAND, AT WHICH TIME THE HELICOPTER BEGAN SPUN TO THE RIGHT FOUR OR FIVE TIMES BEFORE IMPACTING THE WATER. THE PILOT AND THREE PASSENGERS WERE ABLE TO EGRESS FROM THE HELICOPTER. ONE PASSENGER DROWNED. NO PASSENGER BRIEFING WAS CONDUCTED AND NONE OF THE OCCUPANTS WERE SHOWN HOW TO USE THEIR SEATBELTS OR DOORS AS REQUIRED IN 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS PART 91.107. THE VICTIM, WHO WAS SHARING A SEATBELT WITH ANOTHER PASSENGER, HAD NEVER FLOWN IN THE HELICOPTER BEFORE AND WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THE EXITS IN THE HELICOPTER AND HOW TO OPERATE THEM. ACCORDING TO ONE PASSENGER AND MULTIPLE WITNESSES, THUNDERSTORMS AND LIGHTNING WERE OBSERVED AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. EXTREME WEATHER RADAR ECHOES CONTAINING THUNDERSTORMS WERE RECORDED SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE EAST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE. AN ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BY SAFETY BOARD METEOROLOGISTS INDICATES THAT TURBULENCE, INCLUDING VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL WIND CHANGES, WOULD HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY. THE TERRAIN WOULD HAVE ENHANCED THE INTENSITY OF THESE PARAMETERS, RESULTING IN AN ENCOUNTER OF A STRONG CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW OF APPROXIMATELY 45 KNOTS FROM THE SOUTH. TOXICOLOGY TESTING OF BLOOD DRAWN WITHIN AN HOUR AFTER THE ACCIDENT DETECTED BUTALBITAL (A PRESCRIPTION BARBITURATE TYPICALLY USED FOR SEVERE HEADACHES) AND DIPHENHYDRAMINE (AN OVER-THE-COUNTER ANTIHISTAMINE COMMONLY KNOWN BY THE TRADE NAME BENADRYL).  THE DRUG LEVELS SUGGEST THAT THE BUTALBITAL WAS LIKELY TAKEN MORE THAN 24 HOURS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT AND THAT THE DIPHENHYDRAMINE WAS LIKELY TAKEN MUCH MORE RECENTLY (PROBABLY ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT).  THE PILOT HAD A HISTORY OF DIABETES DIAGNOSED IN 1993, WITH NO DOCUMENTATION IN HIS FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION MEDICAL RECORDS SINCE 1994 REGARDING TREATMENT OR CONTROL OF THE DISEASE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DIPHENHYDRAMINE, THE CONDITIONS FOR WHICH THE DETECTED MEDICATIONS WERE USED, OR COMPLICATIONS OR SIDE EFFECTS FROM LONG-STANDING DIABETES MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE PILOT'S DECISION TO FLY AND/OR HIS INABILITY TO CONTROL THE HELICOPTER IN THE PREVAILING CONDITIONS; HOWEVER, THE INVESTIGATION COULD NOT DEFINITIVELY DETERMINE THIS. AN EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER'S SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURE REVEALED NO PREIMPACT ANOMALIES.",THE LOSS OF TAIL ROTOR EFFECTIVENESS AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO REGAIN AIRCRAFT CONTROL. CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S DECISION TO FLY IN KNOWN ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE GUSTY WINDS GENERATED FROM CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW. CONTRIBUTING TO THE SEVERITY OF THE INJURIES WAS THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO PROVIDE A SAFETY BRIEFING TO HIS PASSENGERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL AVIATION REGULATIONS.

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

AN AUTOPSY OF THE PILOT WAS PERFORMED BY THE MARION COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA, ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2008. THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS ATTRIBUTED TO MULTIPLE BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA SUSTAINED IN THE ACCIDENT.

A FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY FATAL ACCIDENT REPORT WAS PREPARED BY THE FAA CIVIL AEROMEDICAL INSTITUTE. THE RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE FOR ALL SUBSTANCES TESTED.

COMPANY INFORMATION

AIR EVAC EMS, LLC, DBA AIR EVAC LIFETEAM, WAS A COMMERCIAL ON-DEMAND AIR TAXI OPERATOR, WHICH WAS AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT PART 135 VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR) DAY AND NIGHT OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY PROVIDED MEDICAL AIR TRANSPORTATION SERVICES FROM A TOTAL OF 82 BASES OVER 13 STATES. THE COMPANY EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 350 PILOTS AND 106 MECHANICS. THE COMPANY OPERATED APPROXIMATELY 100 AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING BELL 206 SERIES AND BELL 407 HELICOPTERS

AIR EVAC UTILIZED AN FAA APPROVED PILOT TRAINING PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSED NEW HIRE, INITIAL AIRCRAFT, RECURRENT, RE-QUALIFICATION, TRANSITION, AND UPGRADE TRAINING. TRAINING ACTIVITY WAS MONITORED BY THE CHIEF PILOT AND DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO INSURE COMPLIANCE WITH COMPANY REQUIREMENTS AND FAA REGULATIONS. THE ACCIDENT PILOT HAD PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED ALL REQUIRED TRAINING AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.

AIR EVAC OPERATED AN ENHANCED OPERATIONAL CONTROL CENTER (EOCC) THAT PROVIDED OVERSIGHT FOR ALL COMPANY FLIGHTS. FLIGHT TRACKING WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH AUTOMATED GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) FLIGHT FOLLOWING AND RADIO COMMUNICATIONS. GPS FLIGHT FOLLOWING PROVIDED THE EOCC WITH AUTOMATED UPDATES OF AIRCRAFT POSITION AND FLIGHT PROGRESS. THIS INFORMATION WAS CONTINUOUSLY DISPLAYED AND AVAILABLE TO EOCC PERSONNEL. THE PILOT WAS ALSO REQUIRED TO MAKE ROUTINE RADIO REPORTS DURING A FLIGHT TO THE EOCC.

AIRCRAFT WERE MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN FAA APPROVED INSPECTION PROGRAM. PROGRAM COMPLIANCE WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEAD MECHANIC AT EACH BASE. MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION PROGRAM ACTIVITY WAS MONITORED AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL BY THE DIRECTOR OF MAINTENANCE.

TESTS AND RESEARCH

THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD MATERIALS LABORATORY CONDUCTED A METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE FAILED ROTOR BLADE. THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS A BONDED ASSEMBLY. THE MAIN COMPONENTS WERE AN EXTRUDED ALUMINUM LEADING EDGE SPAR, WITH UPPER AND LOWER ALUMINUM SKINS, AND AN ALUMINUM HONEYCOMB CORE. IN ADDITION, A LEAD WEIGHT WAS BONDED TO THE INSIDE OF THE LEADING EDGE SPAR.

THE FAILED BLADE BORE A BELL HELICOPTER TEXTRON IDENTIFICATION TAG, WHICH DENOTED PART NUMBER 206-015-001-115 AND SERIAL NUMBER A5165. THE BLADE EXHIBITED A COMPLETE FRACTURE ABOUT 96 INCHES (8 FEET) FROM THE TIP, ABOUT BLADE STATION 126.5. THE PROFILE OF THIS FRACTURE WAS ORIENTED DIRECTLY ACROSS THE BLADE FROM LEADING EDGE TO TRAILING EDGE. A SECOND SECTION OF THE BLADE WAS FRACTURED APPROXIMATELY 134 INCHES FROM THE TIP, ABOUT BLADE STATION 88.5. THE PROFILE OF THIS FRACTURE WAS IRREGULAR.

EXAMINATION OF THE FRACTURE SURFACES COMMON TO THE 8-FOOT BLADE SECTION REVEALED RATCHET MARKS AND FINE ELLIPTICAL CLAMSHELL MARKS TYPICAL OF FATIGUE CRACKING. THESE MARKS EMANATED FROM THE INNER FACE OF THE SPAR AT THE TRANSITION RADIUS BETWEEN THE LEADING EDGE AND THE UPPER WALL. THE CRACK PROPAGATED UPWARD THROUGH THE WALL OF THE SPAR AND TO BOTH SIDES OF THE FATIGUE ORIGIN AREA. THE FATIGUE HAD GROWN TO ENCOMPASS APPROXIMATELY 50-PERCENT OF THE CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA OF THE SPAR PRIOR TO ULTIMATE FAILURE.
 
THE SURFACE OF THE SPAR AT THE FATIGUE ORIGIN EXHIBITED NO EVIDENCE OF CORROSION OR PREVIOUS MECHANICAL DAMAGE (E.G. GOUGES, SCRATCHES, ETC.). THE SPAR DID EXHIBIT FINE LENGTHWISE EXTRUSION MARKS.

THE ORIGIN OF THE FATIGUE CRACK COINCIDED WITH A LARGE VOID IN THE ADHESIVE BETWEEN THE INSIDE SURFACE OF THE SPAR AND THE LEAD WEIGHT. THE CROSS-SECTION OF THE VOID AT THE LOCATION OF THE CRACK INITIATION WAS APPROXIMATELY 0.4 INCHES BY 0.1 INCHES. THE TOTAL LENGTH OF THE VOID EXTENDING BOTH INBOARD AND OUTBOARD OF THE CRACK LOCATION WAS ABOUT 9.2 INCHES. THE SURFACE OF THE SPAR WAS CLEAN AND SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF ADHESIVE MATERIAL BEING IN CONTACT WITH IT AT THE FRACTURE LOCATION.

FURTHER INVESTIGATION BY THE MANUFACTURER DETERMINED THAT THE PRESENCE OF RESIDUAL STRESSES IN THE SPAR FROM THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, IN COMBINATION WITH EXCESSIVE VOIDS BETWEEN THE SPAR AND THE LEAD WEIGHT, CAN LEAD TO A FATIGUE FAILURE OF THE BLADE.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION, THE MANUFACTURER RELEASED ALERT SERVICE BULLETIN 206L-09-159 (REVISION A). THE BULLETIN INFORMED OPERATORS THAT A COMBINATION OF RESIDUAL STRESSES IN THE SPAR AND EXCESSIVE VOIDS BETWEEN THE SPAR AND WEIGHT MAY LEAD TO FATIGUE CRACKING IN THE BLADE. THE BULLETIN INCLUDED A LISTING OF MAIN ROTOR BLADES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE COMBINATION OF RESIDUAL STRESSES AND EXCESSIVE VOIDS BETWEEN THE SPAR AND WEIGHT. FOR THE AFFECTED BLADES, THE BULLETIN RECOMMENDED A RECURRING SURFACE CLEANING (WIPE CHECK) AND VISUAL INSPECTION FOR CRACKS, OR AN X-RAY INSPECTION IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY VOIDS BETWEEN THE SPAR AND THE LEAD WEIGHT. IN THE EVENT THAT THERE ARE NO VOIDS EXCEEDING THE MANUFACTURING LIMITATIONS, NO FURTHER INSPECTION WAS RECOMMENDED. HOWEVER, IF EXCESSIVE VOIDS ARE IDENTIFIED, THE RECURRING VISUAL INSPECTION WAS RECOMMENDED TO CONTINUE FOR THE LIFE OF THE BLADE.

IN ADDITION, DURING THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION, THE MANUFACTURER DETERMINED THAT SEVERAL MAIN ROTOR BLADES HAD BEEN MANUFACTURED WITH AN OVERSIZED SPAR SPACER (AFT SPAR CLOSURE). IN RESPONSE, THE MANUFACTURER ISSUED ALERT SERVICE BULLETIN 206L-09-163. THIS BULLETIN NOTIFIED OPERATORS THAT THE COMBINATION OF AN OVERSIZED SPAR SPACER AND A LARGER THAN ACCEPTABLE VOID BETWEEN THE SPAR AND THE LEAD INERTIA WEIGHT BETWEEN BLADE STATIONS 100 AND 145, MAY CAUSE FATIGUE CRACKING IN THE SPAR. FOR BLADES VERIFIED TO HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED WITH AN OVERSIZED SPAR SPACER, THE BULLETIN RECOMMENDED REDUCING THE SERVICE LIFE OF THE BLADE FROM 3,600 FLIGHT HOURS TO 2,300 FLIGHT HOURS. IN ADDITION, FOR MAIN ROTOR BLADES WITH MORE THAN 1,200 FLIGHT HOURS, A RECURRING SURFACE CLEANING (WIPE CHECK) AND VISUAL INSPECTION FOR CRACKS, OR AN X-RAY INSPECTION IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY VOIDS BETWEEN THE SPAR AND THE LEAD WEIGHT WAS RECOMMENDED. 

OTHER INFORMATION

THE WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED AT THE ACCIDENT SITE DURING THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WERE OBSERVED TO BE CLEAR, WITH 10 MILES VISIBILITY. DAYLIGHT CONDITIONS PREVAILED. THE HELICOPTER WAS EQUIPPED WITH A TERRAIN AWARENESS WARNING SYSTEM (TAWS). A RADAR ALTIMETER WAS INSTALLED ON THE HELICOPTER. THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT WAS BEING TRACKED BY A FLIGHT FOLLOWING PROGRAM, AND DID RECEIVE FLIGHT DISPATCH SERVICES UPON INITIATION OF THE FLIGHT. ADDITIONALLY, A FORMAL FLIGHT RISK ASSESSMENT WAS PERFORMED PRIOR TO THE FLIGHT.

ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006, THE NTSB ISSUED FOUR SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FAA ADDRESSING EMS OPERATIONS. THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS:

NTSB RECOMMENDATION NO. A-06-12 - REQUIRE ALL EMS OPERATORS TO COMPLY WITH 14 CFR PART 135 OPERATIONS SPECIFICATIONS DURING THE CONDUCT OF ALL FLIGHTS WITH MEDICAL PERSONNEL ONBOARD. 

NTSB RECOMMENDATION NO. A-06-13 - REQUIRE ALL EMS OPERATORS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT FLIGHT RISK EVALUATION PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE TRAINING ALL EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION, PROCEDURES THAT SUPPORT THE SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION OF FLIGHT RISKS, AND CONSULTATION WITH OTHERS TRAINED IN EMS FLIGHT OPERATIONS IF THE RISKS REACH A PREDEFINED LEVEL. 

NTSB RECOMMENDATION NO. A-06-14 - REQUIRE EMS OPERATORS TO","THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES CREW HAD ATTENDED A LOCAL FUNDRAISING EVENT AND WAS RETURNING TO THE HELICOPTER/CREW BASE WHEN THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED. WITNESSES REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER MADE A NORMAL DEPARTURE. THEY SUBSEQUENTLY REPORTED SEEING COMPONENTS SEPARATE FROM THE HELICOPTER BEFORE IT DESCENDED AND IMPACTED THE GROUND. THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST IN A CORN FIELD APPROXIMATELY 1.2 MILES FROM THE DEPARTURE POINT. A POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER REVEALED THAT AN 8-FOOT SECTION OF ONE OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES SEPARATED IN-FLIGHT RENDERING THE HELICOPTER UNCONTROLLABLE. METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION DETERMINED THAT THE BLADE FAILED AS A RESULT OF FATIGUE CRACKING. THE ORIGIN OF THE FATIGUE CRACK COINCIDED WITH A LARGE VOID BETWEEN THE BLADE SPAR AND AN INTERNAL LEAD WEIGHT. FURTHER INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE PRESENCE OF RESIDUAL STRESSES IN THE SPAR FROM THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, IN COMBINATION WITH EXCESSIVE VOIDS BETWEEN THE SPAR AND THE LEAD WEIGHT, LIKELY RESULTED IN THE FATIGUE FAILURE OF THE BLADE. THE MANUFACTURER ISSUED AN ALERT SERVICE BULLETIN THAT IDENTIFIED MAIN ROTOR BLADES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE COMBINATION OF RESIDUAL STRESSES AND EXCESSIVE VOIDS BETWEEN THE SPAR AND THE LEAD WEIGHT. THE SERVICE BULLETIN ALSO CALLED FOR SUPPLEMENTAL INSPECTIONS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE CONTINUED AIRWORTHINESS OF THE AFFECTED BLADES.","THE IN-FLIGHT SEPARATION OF A MAIN ROTOR BLADE DUE TO A FATIGUE FAILURE OF THE BLADE SPAR, RENDERING THE HELICOPTER UNCONTROLLABLE, AND THE MANUFACTURER'S PRODUCTION OF MAIN ROTOR BLADES WITH LATENT MANUFACTURING DEFECTS, WHICH PRECIPITATED THE FATIGUE FAILURE OF THE BLADE SPAR."
20081014X22933,1,BELL,407,WPR09TA012,2008,10/13/08 00:00:00,SEDONA,AZ,USA,1.0,True,1.0,BELL,407,32.0,BELL 407,"ON OCTOBER 13, 2008, AT 1518 MOUNTAIN STANDARD TIME, AN ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY (AZ DPS) PARAMEDIC WAS KILLED AFTER COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES OF A BELL 407, N42AZ, NEAR SEDONA, ARIZONA.  THE HELICOPTER WAS OPERATED BY THE AZ DPS AS A PUBLIC-USE SEARCH AND RESCUE (SAR) FLIGHT AND WAS PERFORMING A MOUNTAIN RESCUE ON DOE MOUNTAIN.  THE PILOT AND TWO HIKERS WERE NOT INJURED; THE HELICOPTER WAS NOT DAMAGED.  THE FLIGHT HAD DEPARTED ON THE SAR MISSION FROM THE FLAGSTAFF PULLIAM AIRPORT (FLG), FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA, AT 1440, TO AID IN THE SEARCH AND RESCUE OF TWO STRANDED HIKERS.

ACCORDING TO DPS, THE HELICOPTER AND FLIGHT CREW WERE BASED IN FLAGSTAFF; THE FLIGHT CREW CONSISTED OF A PILOT (RIGHT SEAT) AND A PARAMEDIC (LEFT SEAT).  PRIOR TO DEPARTING FLG, THE FLIGHT CREW HAD BEEN NOTIFIED OF A SAR MISSION BY THE SEDONA FIRE DEPARTMENT.  SEDONA FIRE DEPARTMENT REQUESTED ASSISTANCE IN LOCATING MISSING HIKERS IN THE DOE MOUNTAIN AREA.  THE FLIGHT DEPARTED FLG AND COMMENCED THE SEARCH.  THE FLIGHT CREW CONTACTED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT VIA RADIO THAT THEY HAD LOCATED THE HIKERS ON A MOUNTAIN NORTHWEST OF SEDONA.  

THE PILOT AND BOTH HIKERS WERE INTERVIEWED BY DETECTIVES FROM DPS.

THE PILOT STATED THAT HE LANDED THE HELICOPTER ON A ROCK FACE, WITH BOTH SKIDS ON THE GROUND, AND THE TAIL STICKING OUT OVER THE LEDGE.  HE REPORTED THAT THE LATERAL (LEFT AND RIGHT) OF THE HELICOPTER WAS SOLID.  AS HE LOWERED THE COLLECTIVE AND PLACED THE WEIGHT OF THE HELICOPTER ONTO THE SKIDS HE FELT THE HELICOPTER ROCKING SLIGHTLY FORE AND AFT, AND DECIDED TO MAINTAIN THE MAIN ROTOR AT 100 PERCENT RPM FOR STABILITY REASONS.  HE NOTED THAT THE HIKERS WERE FORWARD AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE HELICOPTER'S POSITION.  THE PILOT STATED THAT AFTER A BRIEF DISCUSSION, THE PARAMEDIC DISCONNECTED HIS RADIO AND DEPARTED OUT OF THE LEFT FORWARD SIDE OF THE HELICOPTER AND WALKED TOWARD THE HIKERS.  HE REPORTED THAT THE PLAN WAS TO LOAD THE HIKERS ONTO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HELICOPTER AS IT HAD BEEN CONFIGURED WITH THE REAR SEATS ON THE RIGHT SIDE.  THE LEFT REAR SEAT WAS TYPICALLY LEFT UNINSTALLED TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE LITTER/STRETCHER IF THERE WAS AN INJURED PATIENT.  THE MALE HIKER WAS HELPED TO THE HELICOPTER FIRST. THEIR PATH WAS TO MOVE RIGHT OF THE HELICOPTER AND THEN DOWNSLOPE PRIOR TO ENTERING THE CABIN.  THE PILOT RECALLED THAT THE PARAMEDIC HAD TO PUSH THE HIKER'S HEAD DOWN PRIOR TO LEADING HIM TO THE HELICOPTER.  WHILE THE MALE HIKER WAS BEING PLACED INSIDE THE HELICOPTER, THE PILOT MAINTAINED A VISUAL ON THE FEMALE HIKER, MAKING SURE THAT SHE DID NOT FOLLOW THE OTHER TWO TO THE HELICOPTER.  HE THEN OBSERVED THE PARAMEDIC WALKING BACK TOWARD THE FEMALE HIKER.  AS THE PARAMEDIC AND HIKER WERE WALKING BACK TO THE HELICOPTER, THE PILOT OBSERVED THAT THE HIKER HAD GOTTEN CAUGHT ON SOMETHING.  THE PARAMEDIC TURNED TO ASSIST THE HIKER, PLACING HIS BACK TO THE PILOT AND HELICOPTER.  THE PILOT STATED THAT AFTER THE PARAMEDIC HELPED THE HIKER, HE TURNED, STOOD UP, ERECT, AND PROCEEDED TO TURN TOWARD THE HELICOPTER.  DURING THIS TIME, THE PILOT, BELIEVING THAT ALL WAS NORMAL, MAY HAVE LOOKED DOWN TO CHECK HIS INSTRUMENTS AND RADIOS; WHEN HE LOOKED BACK UP, HE SAW THE PARAMEDICS FEET COMING OUT FROM UNDERNEATH HIM.

AT THAT POINT THE PILOT REALIZED THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE EXITED THE HELICOPTER TO HELP THE PARAMEDIC, SO HE TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE FEMALE HIKER.  HE REMEMBERED FRICTIONING THE COLLECTIVE, POPPING OPEN HIS DOOR, AND YELLING AT THE HIKER TO GET INTO THE HELICOPTER.  

THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THERE WERE NO MECHANICAL ANOMALIES WITH THE HELICOPTER PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.

ACCORDING TO THE FEMALE HIKER, AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE HELICOPTER, THE PARAMEDIC EXITED THE LEFT SIDE, AND MOTIONED TO BOTH HER AND THE MALE HIKER TO STAY WHERE THEY WERE. THE PARAMEDIC THEN MOTIONED TO THE MALE HIKER TO WALK TOWARDS HIM, AND INSTRUCTED THE FEMALE HIKER TO STAY WHERE SHE WAS.  THE FEMALE HIKER STATED THAT ALL OF THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE VIA HAND SIGNALS, AND THAT THE PARAMEDIC WAS CLEARLY IN CHARGE, AND IN HER OPINION HAD ACTED VERY PROFESSIONALLY.  AFTER THE MALE HIKER WAS PLACED IN THE HELICOPTER, THE PARAMEDIC RETURNED FOR HER.  SHE DID NOT MOVE TOWARD HIM, BUT WAITED FOR HIM TO GET TO HER POSITION.  ONCE THE PARAMEDIC WAS NEAR HER, HE MOTIONED FOR HER TO COME CLOSER TO HIM, WHILE ALSO POINTING OUT A CACTUS PLANT, AND MOTIONING HER AROUND IT.  THE HIKER STATED THAT THE PARAMEDIC AT THIS POINT WAS FACING HER WITH HIS BACK TO THE HELICOPTER, AND STANDING STRAIGHT UP.  SHE BELIEVED THAT HE WAS NOT UNDERNEATH THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES.  SHE WALKED AROUND THE CACTUS, CROUCHED DOWN AND WALKED IN FRONT OF THE PARAMEDIC.  SHE STATED THAT DURING THIS WHOLE TIME THE PARAMEDIC WAS LOOKING AT HER.  SHE WALKED IN FRONT OF HIM, AND WAS WALKING TOWARD THE HELICOPTER WHEN SHE HEARD A LOUD SOUND.  THE HIKER STATED THAT SHE WASN'T SURE WHY SHE TURNED AROUND, BECAUSE OF THE SOUND OR BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT THE PARAMEDIC WAS NOT BEHIND HER ANYMORE. IN ANY CASE, SHE TURNED BACK TO SEE WHERE THE PARAMEDIC WAS AND SAW HIM ON THE GROUND.  AT THAT POINT, SHE FROZE, WANTING TO HELP, AND AT THE SAME TIME SAW THE PILOT LOOKING AT HER AND YELLING TO GET INTO THE HELICOPTER.  

DURING THE MALE HIKER'S INTERVIEW, HE STATED THAT HE HAD OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER WAS TILTED A BIT ON THE PILOT'S SIDE, ""NOT MUCH, BUT DEFINITELY TILTED.""  WHEN THE PARAMEDIC EXITED THE LEFT SIDE AND CAME TOWARD HIM, THE PARAMEDIC WAS STANDING STRAIGHT ERECT.

THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS DOCUMENTED BY AZ DPS.  THEY NOTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE WITH THE NOSE SLIGHTLY ELEVATED.  THEY ALSO INSPECTED THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES AND NOTED THAT ALL OF THE BLADES DISPLAYED MINOR SURFACE ABRASIONS APPROXIMATELY 3 TO 4 INCHES FROM THE TIP OF THE BLADE INBOARD.","THE FLIGHT CREW (PILOT AND PARAMEDIC) HAD BEEN CALLED OUT ON A SEARCH AND RESCUE (SAR) MISSION FOR TWO LOST HIKERS. ONCE THE FLIGHT ARRIVED ON-SCENE, THE CREW LOCATED THE HIKERS AND COMMENCED WITH THE RESCUE. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE OBSERVED A FLAT ROCK AREA NEAR THE HIKERS, AND LANDED AT THAT SPOT. THE SKIDS WERE ON THE ROCK FACE, WITH THE TAIL STICKING OUT OVER THE LEDGE. AS THE PILOT LOWERED THE COLLECTIVE, TO PLACE THE WEIGHT OF THE HELICOPTER ON THE SKIDS, HE FELT A SLIGHT FORE AND AFT ROCKING OF THE HELICOPTER AND DECIDED TO MAINTAIN MAIN ROTOR AT 100 PERCENT RPM FOR STABILITY. THE PARAMEDIC THEN EXITED THE HELICOPTER, AND WALKED TOWARD THE HIKERS WHO WERE FORWARD AND SLIGHTLY UPHILL OF THE HELICOPTER. THE PARAMEDIC ASSISTED THE MALE HIKER INTO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HELICOPTER, AND THEN RETURNED FOR THE FEMALE HIKER. THE FEMALE HIKER REPORTED THAT AFTER THE PARAMEDIC MOTIONED HER TOWARD HIM, HE ALSO POINTED OUT A CACTUS TO HER, MOTIONING FOR HER TO GO AROUND IT. THE HIKER WENT AROUND THE CACTUS, AND THEN STEPPED IN FRONT OF THE PARAMEDIC WHO NOW HAD HIS BACK TO THE HELICOPTER. SHE THEN HEARD A LOUD SOUND AND TURNED BACK TOWARD THE PARAMEDIC, AND SAW HIM LYING ON THE GROUND. THE PARAMEDIC HAD BEEN STRUCK BY THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES. RECONSTRUCTION OF THE EVENT AT THE ACCIDENT SITE REVEALED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE WITH THE NOSE SLIGHTLY ELEVATED. THE PILOT REPORTED NO MECHANICAL ANOMALIES WITH THE HELICOPTER PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.",THE PARAMEDIC'S FAILURE TO MONITOR AND MAINTAIN CLEARANCE FROM THE ROTATING MAIN ROTOR BLADES AFTER EXITING THE HELICOPTER.

ON JANUARY 4, 2009, AT 1409 CENTRAL STANDARD TIME (CST), A SIKORSKY S-76C++ HELICOPTER, N748P, REGISTERED TO AND OPERATED BY PHI, INC. (PHI), AS A 14 CFR PART 135 AIR TAXI FLIGHT USING DAY VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR), CRASHED INTO MARSHY TERRAIN APPROXIMATELY 7 MINUTES AFTER  TAKEOFF AND 12 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE DEPARTURE HELIPORT. THE HELICOPTER SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. BOTH PILOTS AND SIX OF THE SEVEN PASSENGERS WERE KILLED, AND 1 PASSENGER WAS CRITICALLY INJURED. THE HELICOPTER DEPARTED LAKE PALOURDE BASE HELIPORT, A PHI BASE (7LS3), IN AMELIA, LOUISIANA, AND WAS EN ROUTE TO THE SOUTH TIMBALIER OIL PLATFORM ST301B TO TRANSPORT WORKERS FROM TWO DIFFERENT OIL EXPLORATION COMPANIES. NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED WITH THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA), NOR WAS ONE REQUIRED. A COMPANY FLIGHT FOLLOWING PLAN WAS FILED WITH THE PHI COMMUNICATIONS CENTER THAT INCLUDED WEATHER UPDATES, PERTINENT ADVISORIES, AND POSITION REPORTS. THE FLIGHT WAS TRACKED VIA OUTERLINK, A SATELLITE BASED FLEET-TRACKING SYSTEM USED BY THE PHI COMMUNICATIONS CENTER BASED IN LAFAYETTE, LOUISIANA.

THE HELICOPTER DEPARTED 7LS3 AT 1402. THE HELICOPTER’S FLIGHT TRACK, RECORDED BY THE OUTERLINK SYSTEM, ENDED ABOUT 7 MINUTES AFTER DEPARTURE, AT 1409. THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF ANY DISTRESS CALLS OR EMERGENCY TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE FLIGHT CREW ON THE PHI RADIO FREQUENCIES, OR ON ANY MONITORED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL FREQUENCIES.

A SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION WAS INITIATED AT 1414 AFTER THE US AIR FORCE RECEIVED A 406 MHZ EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTER (ELT) DISTRESS SIGNAL WITH THE HELICOPTER’S UNIQUE IDENTIFIER AND LOCATION. NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO PHI AND THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE HELICOPTER WRECKAGE WAS FOUND PARTIALLY SUBMERGED IN A MARSHY BAYOU, NEAR THE LOCATION OF THE LAST OUTERLINK TRACK. 

DATA AND AUDIO RECORDINGS RETRIEVED FROM THE HELICOPTER’S COMBINATION COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER (CVR) AND FLIGHT DATA RECORDER (FDR) INDICATED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS IN LEVEL CRUISE FLIGHT AT 850 FEET MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL), TRAVELING AT 135 KNOTS INDICATED AIR SPEED, WHEN A LOUD ""BANG"" OCCURRED. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ""BANG,"" SOUNDS WERE RECORDED CONSISTENT WITH RUSHING WIND, ENGINE POWER REDUCTIONS ON BOTH ENGINES, AND MAIN ROTOR RPM DECAY. 

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

GENERAL INFORMATION

THE TWIN-ENGINE, 14-SEAT, 2-YEAR-OLD HELICOPTER WAS EQUIPPED WITH GLASS COCKPIT INSTRUMENTATION, A COMBINATION COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER (CVR) AND FLIGHT DATA RECORDER (FDR), AN ENHANCED GROUND PROXIMITY WARNING SYSTEM (EGPWS), SOLID STATE QUICK ACCESS RECORDER (SSQAR), AND A VXP VIBRATION RECORDER. THE TWO TURBOMECA ARRIEL 2S2 TURBO SHAFT ENGINES WERE EQUIPPED WITH DIGITAL ENGINE CONTROL UNITS (DECU). ALL OF THESE DEVICES WERE RECOVERED AND EVALUATED FOR RECORDED INFORMATION. 

ENGINE CONTROL QUADRANT DESIGN

THE SIKORSKY S-76C++ HELICOPTER HAS AN OVERHEAD ENGINE CONTROL QUADRANT THAT HOUSES TWO ENGINE FIRE EXTINGUISHER T-HANDLES, TWO ENGINE POWER CONTROL LEVERS (ECL), TWO FUEL SELECTOR VALVE CONTROL LEVERS, AND VARIOUS SWITCHES FOR OTHER ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS. THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER T-HANDLES, WHICH ARE ABOUT 4 INCHES AFT OF THE CAPTAIN’S AND FIRST OFFICER’S WINDSHIELD, ARE NORMALLY IN THE FULL FORWARD POSITION, AND ARE HELD IN PLACE BY A SPRING-LOADED PIN THAT RESTS IN A DETENT. FORCE IS REQUIRED TO MOVE THE HANDLES OUT OF THE DETENT AND AFT. IN THE EVENT OF AN IN-FLIGHT ENGINE FIRE INDICATION, THE AFFECTED ENGINE'S FIRE EXTINGUISHER T-HANDLE WILL ILLUMINATE, AND THE FLIGHT CREW IS TRAINED TO PULL THE ILLUMINATED HANDLE FULL AFT. IN DOING SO, A MECHANICAL CAM ON THE T-HANDLE LIFTS THE TRIGGER ON THE ECL OUT OF A WEDGE-SHAPED STOP, ALLOWING THE HANDLE TO MOVE AFT, WHICH  REDUCES THE FUEL FLOW TO THE AFFECTED ENGINE. EVENTUALLY, THE FUEL FLOW TO THE ENGINE IS SHUT OFF AS THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER T-HANDLE CONTINUES AFT AND PUSHES THE FUEL SELECTOR VALVE TO THE OFF POSITION. THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER SYSTEM IS THEN AUTOMATICALLY ARMED AND READY FOR THE PILOTS TO RELEASE THE FIRE EXTINGUISHING AGENT INTO THE APPROPRIATE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. 

THE S-76C++ ENGINE CONTROL QUADRANT IS PHYSICALLY SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS MODELS OF THE S-76 SERIES (S-76A, S-76B, S-76C, S-76C+), IN THAT THE ECLS ARE LOCATED IN THE OVERHEAD ENGINE CONTROL QUADRANT. THE S-76A, S-76B, AND S-76C USE PUSH-PULL CABLES TO MANUALLY CONTROL THE ENGINE THROTTLE POSITIONS ON EACH ENGINE’S HYDRO-MECHANICAL UNITS. THE S-76C+ USES AN ELECTRONIC ENGINE CONTROL DESIGN WITH A MANUAL PUSH-PULL CABLE REVERSIONARY MODE. THE ECLS OF THE S-76C++ SERIES ARE BASED ON A DUAL-CHANNEL ALLELECTRONIC ENGINE CONTROL DESIGN, IN THAT THE ECLS ARE ATTACHED TO POTENTIOMETERS THAT TRANSMIT ECL POSITION ELECTRONICALLY TO EACH RESPECTIVE ELECTRONIC ENGINE CONTROL UNIT.
 
WINDSCREENS

IN 2007, ABOUT 2 YEARS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT, PHI REMOVED THE ORIGINAL, FACTORY-INSTALLED LAMINATED GLASS WINDSHIELDS IN N748P AND INSTALLED LIGHTER-WEIGHT CAST ACRYLIC WINDSHIELDS MANUFACTURED BY AERONAUTICAL ACCESSORIES INCORPORATED (AAI).  THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION APPROVED USE OF THE REPLACEMENT WINDSHIELDS UNDER SUPPLEMENTAL TYPE CERTIFICATE SR01340AT, ISSUED TO AAI ON APRIL 16, 1997. THE FAA ALSO ISSUED PARTS MANUFACTURER APPROVAL TO AAI ON AUGUST 3, 1998, FOR MANUFACTURING OF THE REPLACEMENT WINDSHIELDS. THE HELICOPTER’S WINDSHIELDS WERE REPLACED AGAIN IN 2008, ABOUT 1 YEAR BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, DUE TO CRACKING AT THE MOUNTING HOLES. 

LOW ROTOR SPEED WARNING SYSTEMS

THE S-76C++ HELICOPTER'S INTEGRATED INSTRUMENT DISPLAY SYSTEM (IIDS) PROVIDES THE FLIGHT CREW WITH ENGINE AND MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM PERFORMANCE INFORMATION. THREE IIDS SCREENS ARE MOUNTED IN THE INSTRUMENT PANEL; ONE IN FRONT OF THE CAPTAIN, ONE IN FRONT OF THE CO-PILOT, AND ONE IN THE CENTER OF THE INSTRUMENT PANEL (THE MAIN ROTOR [NR] INFORMATION IS ONLY DISPLAYED ON THE PILOT'S AND COPILOT'S IIDS.) THE NR DATA IS PROVIDED TO THE FLIGHT CREW BY A BROAD COLORBAR ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE IIDS. THE IIDS NR COLORBAR IS GREEN WHEN THE HELICOPTER'S NR IS BETWEEN 106 AND 108 PERCENT, YELLOW WHEN THE NR IS BETWEEN 91 AND 105 PERCENT, AND RED WHEN NR IS 90 PERCENT AND BELOW, WARNING THE FLIGHT CREW OF A CRITICAL, UNSAFE FLIGHT CONDITIONS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ACTION. THE HELICOPTER WAS NOT EQUIPPED WITH AN AUDIBLE ALARM OR A MASTER WARNING LIGHT TO ALERT THE FLIGHT CREW OF A LOW NR CONDITION, NOR WAS ONE REQUIRED BY 14 CFR PART 29.THE IIDS ALSO PROVIDES A VISUAL CAUTION LEGEND SUCH AS ""1 OUT OF FLY"" TO THE CREW ANY TIME AN ENGINE SPEED SELECTOR IS OUT OF THE FLY DETENT WITH THE WEIGHT OFF WHEELS. 

PERSONNEL INFORMATION

A REVIEW OF THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT CREW'S TRAINING RECORDS INDICATED THAT BOTH PILOTS HAD ACCOMPLISHED ALL REQUIRED TRAINING AND HAD COMPLETED EMERGENCY INITIAL AND RECURRENT TRAINING IN GROUND SCHOOL AND IN THE SIKORSKY S-76C++ SIMULATOR.

THE 63-YEAR-OLD CAPTAIN HAD APPROXIMATELY 15,373 FLIGHT HOURS WHEN THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED, OF WHICH 14,673 WERE IN ROTORCRAFT; 8,549 AS PILOT-IN-COMMAND; AND 5,423 IN THE S-76. HE HELD AN AIRLINE TRANSPORT PILOT CERTIFICATE FOR HELICOPTERS, AND A COMMERCIAL PILOT CERTIFICATE FOR FIXED-WING AIRPLANES. HE ALSO HELD AN INSTRUMENT RATING FOR HELICOPTERS AND AIRPLANES. HIS LAST FAA FLIGHT PROFICIENCY CHECK WAS ON OCTOBER 27, 2008.  HIS FIRST CLASS FAA MEDICAL WAS ISSUED ON AUGUST 11, 2008, WITH A RESTRICTION THAT HE WEAR CORRECTIVE LENSES WHILE FLYING. HE HAD FLOWN 219 HOURS IN HELICOPTERS IN THE PRECEDING 90 DAYS.

THE 46-YEAR-OLD CO-PILOT HAD APPROXIMATELY 5,524 FLIGHT HOURS, OF WHICH 1,290 WERE IN HELICOPTERS, WITH 962 IN THE S-76. HE HELD AN AIRLINE TRANSPORT PILOT CERTIFICATE FOR HELICOPTERS AND A COMMERCIAL CERTIFICATE FOR FIXED-WING AIRPLANES. HE ALSO HAD A FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR CERTIFICATE VALID FOR GIVING INSTRUCTION IN SINGLE/MULTI-ENGINE AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS.  HIS INSTRUMENT RATING WAS VALID FOR BOTH AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS. HIS LAST FAA FLIGHT PROFICIENCY CHECK WAS ON APRIL 25, 2008, AND HIS LAST FAA FIRST CLASS MEDICAL WAS ISSUED ON FEBRUARY 26, 2008, WITH A RESTRICTION THAT HE WEAR CORRECTIVE LENSES WHILE FLYING. HE HAD FLOWN 205 HOURS IN HELICOPTERS DURING THE PRECEDING 90 DAYS.  

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

THE WEATHER CONDITIONS REPORTED AT AMELIA, LOUISIANA, AT 1430 CST WERE SCATTERED CLOUD LAYERS AT 1,500 FEET AND 3,500 FEET; A BROKEN CLOUD LAYER AT 10,000 FEET; VISIBILITY 10 MILES; WINDS AT 160 DEGREES AT 6 KNOTS; TEMPERATURE OF 24 DEGREES CELSIUS; AND A DEW POINT OF 19 DEGREES CELSIUS.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE MAJORITY OF THE MAJOR COMPONENTS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AND RECOVERED FROM THE ACCIDENT SCENE. EXAMINATION OF THE ACCIDENT SITE INDICATED THAT THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED ON ITS LEFT SIDE ON AN APPROXIMATE HEADING OF 120 DEGREES. EXTENSIVE DEFORMATION ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HELICOPTER WAS NOTED AND EXHIBITED SIGNATURES CONSISTENT WITH HYDRODYNAMIC AND SOFT TERRAIN IMPACT. THE LARGEST PORTION OF THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST IN A MARSH AREA AND CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF THE UPPER DECK FROM ABOVE THE COCKPIT AREA TO THE AFT ENGINE COMPARTMENT. THE CORRESPONDING LOWER FUSELAGE SECTION WAS ADJACENT TO THE UPPER DECK. THE TWO SECTIONS REMAINED ATTACHED BY WIRING HARNESSES ONLY. 

THE TAIL BOOM WAS SEPARATED FROM THE FUSELAGE AT THE FORWARD ATTACH POINT (FUSELAGE STATION 300) AND EXHIBITED EXTENSIVE IMPACT DAMAGE. THE VERTICAL PYLON WAS PARTIALLY SEPARATED FROM THE TAIL BOOM AND WAS DEFORMED TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE LEFT-HAND HORIZONTAL STABILIZER WAS SEPARATED FROM THE TAIL BOOM AND THE RIGHT STABILIZER WAS ATTACHED BUT DAMAGED.  

THE NUMBER 2, 3, AND 4 TAIL ROTOR DRIVESHAFT SEGMENTS, ALONG WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE HANGER BEARINGS, APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN PULLED FORWARD DURING THE IMPACT SEQUENCE AND EXHIBITED MINIMAL ROTATIONAL SCORING/DAMAGE. THE COUPLING DISK PACKS WERE SECURELY ATTACHED TO EACH ASSOCIATED COUPLING AND EXHIBITED MINIMAL DISTORTION. THE NUMBER 4 DRIVESHAFT WAS OBSERVED SEPARATED APPROXIMATELY SIX INCHES FORWARD OF THE INTERMEDIATE GEARBOX ATTACH POINT. THE NUMBER 5 DRIVESHAFT WAS SECURELY ATTACHED TO THE INTERMEDIATE GEARBOX AND THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX.

THE TAIL ROTOR SYSTEM EXHIBITED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE. THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX OUTPUT  HOUSING AND GEAR SEPARATED FROM THE GEARBOX CENTER HOUSING. THE GEAR TEETH APPEARED NORMAL AND DID NOT EXHIBIT ANY PRE-IMPACT ANOMALY. THE BLUE, YELLOW, AND BLACK TAIL ROTOR BLADES EXHIBITED MINIMAL ROTATIONAL IMPACT DAMAGE. THE BLACK AND YELLOW TAIL ROTOR BLADES HAD FRACTURED JUST OUTBOARD OF THEIR RESPECTIVE HUB RETENTION PLATES. THE BLUE BLADE WAS SECURELY ATTACHED TO THE HUB AND THE RED BLADE WAS OBSERVED BROKEN WITH “BROOM STRAW” DAMAGE APPROXIMATELY SEVEN INCHES FROM THE ROOT END OF THE BLADE. THE REMAINING SECTION OF THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX HOUSING WAS OBSERVED SECURELY ATTACHED TO THE UPPER VERTICAL PYLON. THE TAIL GEARBOX MAGNETIC CHIP PLUG WAS REMOVED AND OBSERVED FREE OF FERROUS DEBRIS.

THE FOUR MAIN TRANSMISSION MOUNTS WERE SECURELY ATTACHED TO THE DECK STRUCTURE AND DID NOT EXHIBIT ANY PRE-IMPACT DAMAGE. THE TRANSMISSION ROTATED FREELY. CONTINUITY FROM THE TWO INPUT SHAFTS TO THE MAIN ROTOR HEAD AND TAIL TAKEOFF WAS ESTABLISHED. THE MAGNETIC CHIP PLUGS WERE REMOVED AND OBSERVED CLEAN WITH OIL STILL REMAINING INSIDE OF THEM. THE TRANSMISSION FLUID LEVEL WAS OBSERVED TO BE IN ITS NORMAL STATE.  

THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE SYSTEM EXHIBITED IMPACT DAMAGE CONSISTENT WITH LOW-SPEED ROTATION. THE YELLOW AND BLACK MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE OBSERVED ATTACHED TO THE HUB AND PREDOMINATELY INTACT WITH SOME IMPACT DAMAGE. THE RED BLADE HAD SEPARATED APPROXIMATELY 27 INCHES FROM THE ROOT END OF THE BLADE, AND THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE BLADE WAS RECOVERED. THE BLUE BLADE EXHIBITED TWO SEPARATIONS, ONE AT APPROXIMATELY 40 INCHES FROM THE ROOT AND ANOTHER ABOUT 12 FEET FROM THE ROOT. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL TIP PORTION, APPROXIMATELY 8 FEET OF THE BLUE BLADE WAS NOT RECOVERED.  

THE MAIN ROTOR HUB WAS OBSERVED SECURELY ATTACHED TO THE MAIN ROTOR SHAFT AND EXHIBITED SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT DAMAGE. THE DRIVE LINKS AND SWASHPLATE WERE INTACT AND DID NOT EXHIBIT PRE-IMPACT DAMAGE. THE FOUR PITCH CONTROL RODS WERE OBSERVED SECURELY ATTACHED AND UNDAMAGED. THE THREE MAIN ROTOR SERVO ACTUATORS AND ASSOCIATED HYDRAULIC LINES WERE SECURELY ATTACHED AND DID NOT EXHIBIT ANY PRE-IMPACT ANOMALIES. THE THREE PRIMARY SERVO ACTUATORS ALL DISPLAYED A PART NUMBER OF 76650-09805-111 AND HAD EXPERIENCED A RECORDED 1,104 HOURS OF OPERATIONS SINCE OVERHAUL, WITH AN APPROXIMATE TOTAL TIME OF 3,400 HOURS.

THE ENGINES WERE MOUNTED IN THE AIRFRAME ENGINE COMPARTMENT. THE NO. 1 (LEFT) ENGINE EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT DEFORMATION OF THE LEFT SIDE AND BOTH ENGINES WERE DEFORMED FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE MOUNTS IN A LEFT-TO-RIGHT DIRECTION. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF FIRE, FUEL LEAKS, OR OIL LEAKS.

THE NO. 1 AND NO. 2 AXIAL COMPRESSOR WHEELS ROTATED EASILY. THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF SOME INGESTION OF MUD AND DEBRIS. THE AXIAL COMPRESSOR WHEEL AND BLADES WERE INTACT WITH SOME TIP BENDING. THE POWER TURBINE WHEEL ROTATED EASILY. THE POWER TURBINE WHEEL AND BLADES WERE INTACT AND THERE WERE SIGNS OF BLADE RUB ON THE BOTTOM OF THE HOUSING, CONSISTENT WITH A HARD LANDING OR IMPACT. THE SHORT SHAFTS WERE OBSERVED PULLED OUT OF THE ENGINE OUTPUT COUPLING FOR BOTH ENGINES BUT SECURELY ATTACHED TO THE TRANSMISSION INPUTS. THE FLEXIBLE COUPLINGS AND TRIANGULAR FLANGE EXHIBITED MINIMAL DEFORMATION.

COMPLETE CONTROL CONTINUITY COULD NOT BE ESTABLISHED FROM THE COCKPIT AFT TO THE MIXING UNIT DUE TO IMPACT DAMAGE AND CRUSH DEFORMATION OF THE AIRFRAME. CONTROL CONTINUITY WAS ESTABLISHED FROM THE MIXING UNIT TO THE FLIGHT CONTROL SERVOS TO THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES. NO PRE-IMPACT ANOMALIES WERE OBSERVED. ALL HYDRAULIC FLUID RESERVOIRS WERE FOUND TO BE FULL OF HYDRAULIC FLUID WITH NO EVIDENCE OF LEAKAGE NOTED. 

FLIGHT RECORDER INFORMATION

DATA FROM THE PENNY AND GILES COMBINATION FDR AND CVR WERE ANALYZED AT THE NTSB'S RECORDERS LABORATORY WITH DOWNLOAD ASSISTANCE FROM THE MANUFACTURER'S FACILITY IN ENGLAND AND THE US ARMY SAFETY CENTER IN FORT RUCKER, ALABAMA. BOTH RECORDERS CAPTURED THE ENTIRE ACCIDENT FLIGHT. 

THE CVR RECORDED THE SOUND OF A BANG AND A LOUD AIR NOISE FOLLOWED BY A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE BACKGROUND NOISE LEVEL THAT WAS RECORDED ON BOTH INTERCOM MICROPHONES AND THE COCKPIT AREA MICROPHONE. LESS THAN A SECOND AFTER THE BANG AND LOUD AIR NOISE, THE CVR CAPTURED THE SOUND OF DECREASING ROTOR AND ENGINE RPM. SEVENTEEN SECONDS LATER, THE RECORDING ENDED. 

THE NON-VOLATILE MEMORY (NVM) FROM THE ENGINES' DIGITAL ENGINE ELECTRONIC CONTROL UNITS (EECUS) WAS SUCCESSFULLY DOWNLOADED AND NO FAULTS WERE RECORDED. 

TESTS AND RESEARCH

ENGINE EXAMINATIONS

ON JANUARY 22, 2009, THE NO. 2 ENGINE, A TURBOMECA ARRIEL 2S2, SN 21010, WAS DISASSEMBLED UNDER NTSB SUPERVISION. OTHER THAN IMPACT DAMAGE, NO ANOMALIES WERE NOTED. THE ENGINE’S HYDROMECHANICAL UNIT (HMU) WAS REMOVED AND EXAMINED. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT COULD BE RUN ON A TEST BENCH. PRIOR TO RUNNING THE HMU, THE POSITION OF THE RESOLVER AND THE MANUAL MICROSWITCH WERE DETERMINED. THE RESOLVER WAS AT 59.33 DEGREES, WHICH EQUATES TO A FUEL FLOW OF ABOUT 137 POUNDS PER HOUR AND AN N1 OF ABOUT 86.8 PERCENT. THE MANUAL MICROSWITCH WAS FOUND TO BE IN THE OPEN OR NEUTRAL POSITION, INDICATING THAT THE HMU WAS IN THE AUTOMATIC MODE. THE HMU WAS THEN RUN ON THE TEST BENCH WITH NO SIGNIFICANT OUT-OF-LIMITS NOTED; HOWEVER, THERE WAS A FUEL LEAK OBSERVED THAT APPEARED TO BE FROM THE VARILIP SEAL. AS FUEL PRESSURE INCREASED, THE FUEL LEAK DECREASED. 

ON JANUARY 23, 2009, THE NO. 1 ENGINE, A TURBOMECA ARRIEL 2S2, SN 21022, WAS DISASSEMBLED. OTHER THAN IMPACT DAMAGE, NO ANOMALIES WERE NOTED. THE ENGINE’S HMU WAS REMOVED AND EXAMINED. IMPACT DAMAGE TO THE UNIT PRECLUDED IT FROM BEING RUN ON THE TEST BENCH. THE POSITION OF THE RESOLVER AND THE MANUAL MICROSWITCH WERE DETERMINED. THE RESOLVER WAS AT 28.38 DEGREES, WHICH EQUATES TO A FUEL FLOW OF ABOUT 250 POUNDS PER HOUR AND AN N1 OF ABOUT 98.0 PERCENT. THE MANUAL MICROSWITCH WAS FOUND TO BE IN THE OPEN OR NEUTRAL POSITION, INDICATING THAT THE HMU WAS IN THE AUTOMATIC MODE.

THE FZ-706 DIGITAL FLIGHT COMPUTER, P/N 7015480-903, S/N 05061626, WAS CONNECTED TO TEST EQUIPMENT AND THE ERROR CODES WERE SUCCESSFUL","A SIKORSKY S-76C++ DEPARTED ON AN AIR TAXI FLIGHT FROM PHI, INC.’S HELIPORT EN ROUTE TO AN OFFSHORE OIL PLATFORM WITH TWO PILOTS AND SEVEN PASSENGERS. DATA FROM THE HELICOPTER’S FLIGHT DATA RECORDER INDICATED THAT THE HELICOPTER ESTABLISHED LEVEL CRUISE FLIGHT AT 850 FEET MEAN SEA LEVEL AND 135 KNOTS INDICATED AIR SPEED. ABOUT 7 MINUTES AFTER DEPARTURE, THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER RECORDED A LOUD BANG, FOLLOWED BY SOUNDS CONSISTENT WITH RUSHING WIND AND A POWER REDUCTION ON BOTH ENGINES AND A DECAY OF MAIN ROTOR REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE. DUE TO THE SUDDEN POWER LOSS, THE HELICOPTER DEPARTED CONTROLLED FLIGHT AND DESCENDED RAPIDLY INTO MARSHY TERRAIN.

EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED THAT BOTH THE LEFT AND RIGHT SECTIONS OF THE CAST ACRYLIC WINDSHIELD WERE SHATTERED. FEATHERS AND OTHER BIRD REMAINS WERE COLLECTED FROM THE CANOPY AND WINDSHIELD AT THE INITIAL POINT OF IMPACT AND FROM OTHER LOCATIONS ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE HELICOPTER. LABORATORY ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THE REMAINS AS COMING FROM A FEMALE RED-TAILED HAWK; THE FEMALES OF THAT SPECIES HAVE AN AVERAGE WEIGHT OF 2.4 POUNDS. NO DEFECTS IN THE MATERIALS, MANUFACTURING, OR CONSTRUCTION WERE OBSERVED. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF ANY PREEXISTING DAMAGE THAT CAUSED THE WINDSHIELD TO SHATTER. THUS, THE FRACTURES AT THE TOP OF THE RIGHT SECTION OF THE WINDSHIELD AND DAMAGE TO THE CANOPY IN THAT AREA WERE CONSISTENT WITH A BIRD IMPACTING THE CANOPY JUST ABOVE THE TOP EDGE OF THE WINDSHIELD. THE FRACTURES IN THE OTHER AREAS OF THE WINDSHIELDS WERE CAUSED BY GROUND IMPACT.

THE S-76C++ HELICOPTER HAS AN OVERHEAD ENGINE CONTROL QUADRANT THAT HOUSES, AMONG OTHER COMPONENTS, TWO ENGINE FIRE EXTINGUISHER T-HANDLES AND TWO ENGINE POWER CONTROL LEVERS (ECL). THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER T-HANDLES, WHICH ARE LOCATED ABOUT 4 INCHES AFT OF THE CAPTAIN’S AND FIRST OFFICER’S WINDSHIELDS, ARE NORMALLY IN THE FULL-FORWARD POSITION DURING FLIGHT, AND EACH IS HELD IN PLACE BY A SPRING-LOADED PIN THAT RESTS IN A DETENT; AFT PULLING FORCE IS REQUIRED TO MOVE THE T-HANDLES OUT OF THEIR DETENTS. IF THE T HANDLES ARE MOVED AFT, A MECHANICAL CAM ON EACH T-HANDLE PUSHES THE TRIGGER ON THE ASSOCIATED ECL OUT OF ITS WEDGE-SHAPED STOP, ALLOWING THE ECL TO MOVE AFT, REDUCING FUEL TO THE ENGINE THAT THE ECL CONTROLS. (FLIGHT CREWS ARE TRAINED TO MOVE AN ENGINE’S FIRE EXTINGUISHER T-HANDLE FULL AFT IN THE EVENT OF AN IN-FLIGHT FIRE SO THAT THE ECL CAN MOVE AFT AND SHUT OFF THE FUEL FLOW TO THE AFFECTED ENGINE.) 

THE IMPACT OF THE BIRD ON THE CANOPY JUST ABOVE THE WINDSHIELD NEAR THE ENGINE CONTROL QUADRANT LIKELY JARRED THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER T-HANDLES OUT OF THEIR DETENTS AND MOVED THEM AFT, PUSHING BOTH ECL TRIGGERS OUT OF THEIR STOPS AND ALLOWING THEM TO MOVE AFT AND INTO OR NEAR THE FLIGHT-IDLE POSITION, REDUCING FUEL TO BOTH ENGINES. A SIMILAR INCIDENT OCCURRED ON NOVEMBER 13, 1999, IN WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA, WHEN A BIRD STRUCK THE WINDSHIELD OF AN S-76C+ HELICOPTER, N276TH, OPERATED BY PALM BEACH COUNTY. THE BIRD DID NOT PENETRATE THE LAMINATED GLASS WINDSHIELD, BUT THE IMPACT FORCE OF THE BIRD CRACKED THE WINDSHIELD AND DISLODGED THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER T-HANDLES OUT OF THEIR DETENTS; HOWEVER, IN THAT CASE, THE FORCE WAS NOT GREAT ENOUGH TO MOVE THE ECLS. 

MAINTENANCE RECORDS INDICATED THAT PHI REPLACED THE ORIGINAL LAMINATED GLASS WINDSHIELDS DELIVERED ON THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WITH AFTER-MARKET CAST ACRYLIC WINDSHIELDS ABOUT 2 YEARS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. THE AFTER-MARKET WINDSHIELDS PROVIDED A WEIGHT SAVINGS OVER THE ORIGINAL WINDSHIELDS. PHI AGAIN REPLACED THE WINDSHIELDS (DUE TO CRACKING) WITH CAST ACRYLIC WINDSHIELDS ABOUT 1 YEAR BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. AERONAUTICAL ACCESSORIES INCORPORATED (AAI) DESIGNED AND PRODUCED THE AFTER-MARKET WINDSHIELDS AND OBTAINED SUPPLEMENTAL TYPE CERTIFICATE (STC) APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) IN APRIL 1997. AAI DID NOT PERFORM ANY BIRD-IMPACT TESTING ON THE CAST ACRYLIC WINDSHIELDS SUPPLIED FOR THE S-76C++, AND THE FAA’S APPROVAL OF THE STC DID NOT REQUIRE SUCH TESTING.  

PHI ALSO REPLACED THE ORIGINAL WINDSHIELDS ON OTHER HELICOPTERS WITH THE CAST ACRYLIC WINDSHIELDS; ONE OF THESE HELICOPTERS EXPERIENCED A BIRD-STRIKE INCIDENT ABOUT 2 YEARS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. POSTINCIDENT EXAMINATION REVEALED A NEAR-CIRCULAR HOLE WITH RADIATING CRACKS NEAR THE TOP CENTER OF THE RIGHT WINDSHIELD. THE BIRD PENETRATED THE WINDSHIELD AND PUSHED THE RIGHT-SIDE T-HANDLE. THE TRAPPED REMAINS OF THE BIRD PREVENTED THE RIGHT-SIDE THROTTLE FROM BEING REENGAGED, BUT THE PILOT WAS ABLE TO LAND THE HELICOPTER SAFELY. 

IN 1978, WHEN THE S-76 WAS CERTIFICATED, THERE WERE NO BIRD-STRIKE REQUIREMENTS. CURRENTLY, 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS 29.631 (IN EFFECT SINCE AUGUST 8, 1996) STATES THAT, AT A MINIMUM, A TRANSPORT-CATEGORY HELICOPTER, SUCH AS THE S-76C++, SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF SAFE LANDING AFTER IMPACT WITH A 2.2-POUND BIRD AT A SPECIFIED VELOCITY. THIS REQUIREMENT INCLUDES WINDSHIELDS. CURRENT FAA REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSPORT-CATEGORY HELICOPTER WINDSHIELDS ALSO STATE THAT “WINDSHIELDS AND WINDOWS MUST BE MADE OF MATERIAL THAT WILL NOT BREAK INTO DANGEROUS FRAGMENTS.” 

ABOUT 4 MONTHS AFTER THIS ACCIDENT, SIKORSKY ISSUED A SAFETY ADVISORY TO ALL OPERATORS OF THE S-76C++ REGARDING THE REDUCED SAFETY OF ACRYLIC WINDSHIELDS (BOTH CAST AND STRETCHED) COMPARED TO THE HELICOPTER’S ORIGINAL WINDSHIELD. ACCORDING TO THE ADVISORY, THE S-76C++’S LAMINATED GLASS WINDSHIELD DEMONSTRATED MORE TOLERANCE TO PENETRATING DAMAGE FROM IN-FLIGHT IMPACTS (SUCH AS BIRD STRIKES) COMPARED TO ACRYLIC WINDSHIELDS. SIKORSKY EXPRESSED CONCERN IN THE SAFETY ADVISORY THAT THE PRESENCE OF A HOLE THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, WHETHER CREATED DIRECTLY BY OBJECT PENETRATION OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH CRACK INTERSECTIONS, MAY CAUSE ADDITIONAL DAMAGE TO THE HELICOPTER, CAUSE DISORIENTATION OR INJURY TO THE FLIGHT CREW, INCREASE PILOT WORKLOAD, OR CREATE ADDITIONAL CREW-COORDINATION CHALLENGES. THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT, FOLLOWING THIS ACCIDENT, PHI IS REPLACING ALL OF THE WINDSHIELDS IN ITS S 76 HELICOPTERS WITH WINDSHIELDS THAT MEET EUROPEAN BIRD-STRIKE STANDARDS. 

BASED ON MAIN ROTOR SPEED DECAY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SIKORSKY, THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT CREW HAD, AT MOST, ABOUT 6 SECONDS TO REACT TO THE DECAYING ROTOR SPEED CONDITION. HAD THEY QUICKLY RECOGNIZED THE CAUSE OF THE POWER REDUCTION AND REACTED VERY RAPIDLY, THEY WOULD LIKELY HAVE HAD ENOUGH TIME TO RESTORE POWER TO THE ENGINES BY MOVING THE ECLS BACK INTO POSITION. HOWEVER, THE FLIGHT CREWMEMBERS WERE LIKELY DISORIENTED FROM THE BIRD STRIKE AND THE RUSH OF AIR THROUGH THE FRACTURED WINDSHIELD; THUS, THEY DID NOT HAVE TIME TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF THE POWER REDUCTION AND TAKE ACTION TO MOVE THE ECLS BACK INTO POSITION. 

THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WAS NOT EQUIPPED WITH AN AUDIBLE ALARM OR A MASTER WARNING LIGHT TO ALERT THE FLIGHT CREW OF A LOW-ROTOR-SPEED CONDITION. AN ENHANCED WARNING COULD HAVE HELPED THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT CREW QUICKLY IDENTIFY THE DECAYING ROTOR SPEED CONDITION AND PROVIDED THE FLIGHT CREW WITH MORE OPPORTUNITY TO INITIATE THE NECESSARY CORRECTIVE EMERGENCY ACTIONS BEFORE IMPACT.","(1) THE SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER TO BOTH ENGINES THAT RESULTED FROM IMPACT WITH A BIRD (RED-TAILED HAWK), WHICH FRACTURED THE WINDSHIELD AND INTERFERED WITH ENGINE FUEL CONTROLS, AND (2) THE SUBSEQUENT DISORIENTATION OF THE FLIGHT CREWMEMBERS, WHICH LEFT THEM UNABLE TO RECOVER FROM THE LOSS OF POWER. CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WERE (1) THE LACK OF FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE, AT THE TIME THE HELICOPTER WAS CERTIFICATED, REQUIRING HELICOPTER WINDSHIELDS TO BE RESISTANT TO BIRD STRIKES; (2) THE LACK OF PROTECTIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT THE T HANDLES FROM INADVERTENTLY DISLODGING OUT OF THEIR DETENTS; AND (3) THE LACK OF A MASTER WARNING LIGHT AND AUDIBLE SYSTEM TO ALERT THE FLIGHT CREW OF A LOW-ROTOR-SPEED CONDITION."

ON NOVEMBER 14, 2009, ABOUT 0201 PACIFIC STANDARD TIME, AN AEROSPATIALE AS350BA, N5793P, COLLIDED WITH TERRAIN NEAR DOYLE, CALIFORNIA. MOUNTAIN LIFEFLIGHT WAS OPERATING THE HELICOPTER UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS (CFR) PART 91. THE COMMERCIAL PILOT AND TWO PASSENGERS SUSTAINED FATAL INJURIES; THE HELICOPTER WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED BY IMPACT FORCES AND POST-CRASH FIRE. THE CROSS-COUNTRY POSITIONING FLIGHT DEPARTED RENO, NEVADA, ABOUT 0143 WITH A PLANNED DESTINATION OF SUSANVILLE, CALIFORNIA. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED, AND A COMPANY FLIGHT PLAN HAD BEEN FILED.

THE HELICOPTER DEPARTED ITS HOME BASE AT SUSANVILLE AIRPORT AT 0016, AND PICKED UP A PATIENT AT BANNER HOSPITAL IN SUSANVILLE. IT DEPARTED SUSANVILLE AT 0038, AND ARRIVED AT RENOWN HOSPITAL IN RENO AT 0111. IT DEPARTED RENOWN HOSPITAL AT 0143, AND THE MEDICAL CREW MADE POSITION REPORTS EVERY 10 MINUTES TO ITS DISPATCH CENTER IN SUSANVILLE. AT 0153, THEY REPORTED HALLELUJAH JUNCTION; SUSANVILLE WAS 43 MILES AT 311 DEGREES, AND THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS 5 MILES AT 341 DEGREES. AT 0201, DISPATCH RECEIVED A TRANSMISSION THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS GOING DOWN.

LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL INTERVIEWED A WITNESS WHO WAS IN A CAR ON NEARBY HIGHWAY 395. THE WITNESS OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER FLYING STRAIGHT AND LEVEL; IT THEN DESCENDED VERTICALLY AT A RAPID RATE. THE WITNESS LOST SIGHT OF IT BEHIND TERRAIN, AND THEN OBSERVED A FIREBALL. THE WITNESS DROVE ON A DIRT ROAD, AND FOUND THE WRECKAGE, WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY 1/4 MILE WEST OF HIGHWAY 395.

THE COMPANY REPORTED THAT THE PILOT DEPARTED AT 1955 ON THE SAME ROUND TRIP (BASE TO BANNER HOSPITAL TO RENO AND RETURN), BUT WITH A DIFFERENT MEDICAL CREW ON BOARD. BOTH CREWMEN STATED THAT THE PILOTS TYPICALLY FLEW ABOUT 8,500 FEET MSL, WHICH WAS ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN TOPS ALONG THEIR ROUTE OF FLIGHT. THE PILOTS TYPICALLY FOLLOWED HIGHWAY 395 IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE BEST VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE GROUND.

THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) INVESTIGATOR-IN-CHARGE (IIC) REVIEWED RECORDED RADAR DATA. THE HELICOPTER WAS USING A DISCREET CODE OF 0465. A PLOT OF THE RADAR TRACK IS PART OF THE PUBLIC DOCKET. THE FIRST TARGET APPEARED AT 0144:16, AT A MODE C REPORTED ALTITUDE OF 4,700 FEET MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL); IT WAS AT THE APPROXIMATE COORDINATES FOR RENOWN HOSPITAL, WHICH WAS AT AN ESTIMATED ELEVATION OF 4,500 FEET. IT CLIMBED ON A NORTHWESTERLY COURSE FOR ABOUT 5 MILES, AND THEN TURNED ABOUT 15° LEFT FOR 4 MILES UNTIL THE TARGET WAS LOST AT 0150:08. AT THIS POINT, IT WAS ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN HIGHWAY 395 AND RENO STEAD AIRPORT, AND INDICATING A MODE C ALTITUDE OF 7,100 FEET.

THE TARGET WAS REACQUIRED AT 0200:19, AT A MODE C ALTITUDE OF 9,200 FEET IN THE VICINITY OF THE ACCIDENT SITE. THE TARGET TRACKED TO THE NORTHEAST FOR ABOUT 0.6 MILE, AND CLIMBED TO 9,700 FEET BY 0200:43. THE NEXT TARGET, WHICH OCCURRED 10 SECONDS LATER, WAS BACK TO THE SOUTHWEST AT AN ALTITUDE OF 9,800 FEET. AT 0201:06, THE TARGET WAS WEST OF THE PREVIOUS LOCATION AT A MODE C ALTITUDE OF 10,100 FEET; A TARGET 5 SECONDS LATER WAS ESSENTIALLY IN THE SAME LOCATION AT 10,200 FEET. THE NEXT TARGET WAS LESS THAN 5 SECONDS LATER AND NORTHEAST OF THE PREVIOUS TWO TARGETS. ABOUT 10 SECONDS LATER, THE NEXT TARGET CONTINUED TO THE NORTHEAST. THE LAST TWO TARGETS OCCURRED 4.5 SECONDS APART; THEY WERE AT 10,200 FEET, AND COLLOCATED ABOUT 90° EAST OF THE PREVIOUS TARGET. THIS LOCATION WAS WITHIN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE ACCIDENT SITE.

METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS

AN NTSB METEOROLOGIST PROVIDED A WEATHER BRIEF. 

THE CLOSEST OFFICIAL WEATHER OBSERVATION STATION WAS RENO (KRNO), WHICH WAS 25 NAUTICAL MILES (NM) AT 150° FROM THE ACCIDENT SITE AT AN ELEVATION OF 4,415 FEET MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL). AN AVIATION ROUTINE WEATHER REPORT (METAR) WAS ISSUED AT 0155 PST. IT STATED: WIND FROM 340° AT 6 KNOTS; VISIBILITY 10 MILES; SKIES 5,500 FEET BROKEN; TEMPERATURE 4/39° CELSIUS(C)/FAHRENHEIT(F); DEW POINT -3/25°C/F; ALTIMETER 29.96 INCHES OF MERCURY.

DOPPLER WEATHER RADAR GAVE NO INDICATION OF PRECIPITATION IN THE AREA. NO PIREPS WERE AVAILABLE NEAR THE TIME OF ACCIDENT.

METARS FROM KRNO AND TRUCKEE, CALIFORNIA (KTRK), (33 NM SOUTH AT AN ELEVATION OF 5,900 FEET) INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF CLOUDS IN THE AREA. KRNO AND KTRK REPORTED CLOUD BASES AS BROKEN AT 5,500 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL (AGL OR APPROXIMATELY 9,900 FEET MSL) AND 3,200 FEET AGL (APPROXIMATELY 9,100 FEET MSL), RESPECTIVELY. VISIBILITY WAS AT OR GREATER THAN 10 STATUTE MILES.

GOES11 AND MODIS INFRARED IMAGERY CONFIRMED CLOUDS IN THE AREA AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURES IN THE MODIS INFRARED IMAGERY FOR CLOUDS IN THE AREA WERE -12°C, WHICH CORRESPONDED TO CLOUD TOPS REACHING ABOUT 13,000 FEET MSL.

A RAWINSONDE LAUNCH FROM KRNO AT 1200 UNIVERSAL COORDINATED TIME, AS WELL AS METEOROLOGICAL MODEL DATA, INDICATED LIGHT CLEAR ICING AT THE UPSET ALTITUDE, WITH POTENTIAL FOR MODERATE CLEAR ICING IN/NEAR CLOUDS.

FOR THE CALIFORNIA FORECASTING REGION, THERE WAS NO ACTIVE AIRMET SIERRA, TANGO OR ZULU FOR THE ACCIDENT LOCATION/TIME. HOWEVER, THERE WAS AN ACTIVE AIRMET ZULU FOR ICE BETWEEN 4,000 FEET AND 12,000 FEET MSL NEAR THE ACCIDENT SITE.

FOR THE NEVADA FORECASTING REGION, THERE WAS AN ACTIVE AIRMET TANGO FOR MODERATE TURBULENCE AT FLIGHT LEVELS 180-390. THIS FORECAST EXTENDED INTO CALIFORNIA, BUT THERE WERE NO OTHER ACTIVE AIRMETS FOR THE ACCIDENT TIME AND LOCATION.

TWO CREW MEMBERS FLEW ON A FLIGHT EARLIER IN THE EVENING WITH THE ACCIDENT PILOT. ONE STATED THAT HE DIDN’T OBSERVE CLOUDS ON THEIR FLIGHT; IF THERE WERE ANY, HE SAID THAT THEY WERE ABOVE THEM AND VERY FEW. HE WAS ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE ROUTE. THE OTHER NOTED THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE MOON, AND IT WAS A VERY DARK NIGHT.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

INVESTIGATORS EXAMINED THE WRECKAGE AT THE ACCIDENT SCENE. DETAILED ON SITE NOTES ARE IN THE PUBLIC DOCKET. THE FIRST IDENTIFIED POINT OF CONTACT (FIPC) CONSISTED OF THREE PARALLEL GROUND SCARS. THE CENTER SCAR CONTAINED THE RECOGNITION LIGHT FIXTURE. ALL REFERENCES IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS REFLECT LEFT AND RIGHT OF THE DEBRIS PATH CENTERLINE AND DISTANCE FROM THE FIPC.

THE DEBRIS PATH WAS 305 FEET ALONG A MAGNETIC HEADING OF 230 DEGREES; THE FIRST HALF OF THE PATH WAS ON A 20-DEGREE DOWNSLOPE OF UNEVEN TERRAIN.

THE VERTICAL STABILIZERS SEPARATED AS A UNIT, AND WERE AT 29 FEET. LANDING GEAR PIECES WERE ABOUT 15 FEET TO THE RIGHT OF THEM.

THE TAILBOOM WITH TAIL ROTOR ATTACHED SEPARATED AFT OF THE CABIN, AND CAME TO REST ON ITS RIGHT SIDE AT 58 FEET. THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TAILBOOM WAS CRUSHED IN AND AFT WITH WRINKLES; IT SUSTAINED MORE DAMAGE THAN THE RIGHT SIDE. SCRAPE MARKS FROM THE FRONT TO THE REAR ON THE LEFT SIDE WERE PARALLEL TO THE LONGITUDINAL AXIS, AND WERE VISIBLE WITHIN THE FOLDS OF THE WRINKLES. THE RIGHT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER SUSTAINED LESS DAMAGE THAN THE LEFT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER, WHICH WAS CRUSHED AFT AND UP.

THE GROUND AND BRUSH TO THE RIGHT OF THE TAILBOOM WAS SCORCHED, AND THE SCORCHING CONTINUED DOWNHILL TO THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES.

THE COCKPIT AREA AND INSTRUMENT PANEL WERE AT 140 FEET; THEY WERE HIGHLY FRAGMENTED AND BURNED. THEY CAME TO REST AGAINST AN EARTH BERM SEVERAL FEET HIGH; AFTER THE BERM, THE TERRAIN FLATTENED. MAJOR SEGMENTS OF THE CYCLIC, ANTITORQUE PEDALS, AND INSTRUMENT PANEL WERE IDENTIFIED. A GENEVA CENTER PEDESTAL WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE DEBRIS FIELD; IT EXHIBITED CRUSH DAMAGE, AND MOST SWITCHES WERE IN THE FORWARD POSITION.

INVESTIGATORS FOUND FLIGHT CONTROL PIECES ALONG THE FLIGHT PATH. THESE INCLUDED SEGMENTS OF THE MIXING UNIT AND COLLECTIVE TORQUE TUBE; THE FRACTURE SURFACES WERE BENT AND ANGULAR.

ABOUT 30 FEET RIGHT OF THE COCKPIT WERE PIECES OF THE LANDING GEAR. THE STEEL EXTENSIONS AT THE BACK OF THE LANDING GEAR WERE BENT UP (THEIR NORMAL POSITION IS 5 DEGREES DOWN).

AFTER THE BERM WAS THE MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX WITH THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES ATTACHED. THE MAIN ROTOR HEAD WAS MANUALLY ROTATED WITH RESULTING ROTATION OF PLANETARY GEARS. THE TRANSMISSION DRIVE SHAFT SEPARATED JUST AFT OF THE INPUT FLANGE, AND REMAINED CONNECTED TO THE LIAISON TUBE AND ENGINE. THE FRACTURE SURFACE WAS BENT AND TWISTED. THE TRANSMISSION INPUT FLEX COUPLING REMAINED INTACT AND ATTACHED TO THE TRANSMISSION INPUT FLANGE.

THE FLIGHT CONTROL TUBES FRAGMENTED AND THE FRACTURE SURFACES WERE BENT AND ANGULAR. THE STARFLEX MAIN ROTOR HEAD REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE TRANSMISSION. THE BLADE ORDER IN THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION WAS YELLOW, BLUE, AND RED. THE RED SLEEVE SUSTAINED THE MOST DAMAGE; IT HAD RETREATED AND WAS BROOMSTRAWED. THE RED STAR ARM SEPARATED, AND WAS FOUND NEAR THE TAIL CONE. THE YELLOW SLEEVE WAS ADVANCED; THE YELLOW STAR ARM FRACTURED AND SEPARATED. THE BLUE SLEEVE WAS STILL INTACT; THE BLUE STAR ARM WAS FRACTURED, BUT STILL IN POSITION. 

ALL THREE MAIN ROTOR BLADES EXHIBITED CHORD WISE BENDING AND TRAILING EDGE SPLITTING. THE YELLOW BLADE EXHIBITED THE LEAST AMOUNT OF DAMAGE OF THE THREE BLADES. THE OUTBOARD SECTION OF BLUE BLADE EXHIBITED IMPACT AND FIRE DAMAGE. THE RED BLADE WAS THE MOST EXTENSIVELY DAMAGED, AND EXHIBITED THE MOST FIRE DAMAGE OF THE THREE BLADES. THE SPARS ON THE BLADES DID NOT APPEAR TO BE EXTENSIVELY DAMAGED.

THE TAIL ROTOR REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX. THE TAIL ROTOR PADDLES WERE CRACKED AT THE CUFFS, AND EXHIBITED MINIMAL ROTATIONAL SCORING.

A SUBSTANCE THAT SMELLED LIKE AVIATION JET FUEL WAS EVIDENT AT THE SITE. THE FUEL CUTOFF VALVE WAS FOUND ALONG THE WRECKAGE PATH IN THE CLOSED POSITION; HOWEVER, DEBRIS WAS FOUND INSIDE THE VALVE WHEN IT WAS OPENED. THE VALVE WAS CABLE OPERATED IN TENSION TO OFF POSITION.

THE ENGINE, WHICH SPLIT OPEN, WAS AT 220 FEET. 

THE MOST DISTANT ITEM OF MAJOR WRECKAGE LOCATED, AT 292 FEET, WAS THE SUN GEAR FROM THE MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX.

AN ADDITIONAL EXAMINATION OF THE ACCIDENT SITE OCCURRED ON MAY 18, 2010. INVESTIGATORS USED METAL DETECTORS TO LOCATE ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS. THESE INCLUDED BALL BEARINGS FROM THE GOVERNOR.

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

THE WASHOE COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER/CORONER COMPLETED AN AUTOPSY, AND DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS MULTIPLE BLUNT FORCE INJURIES. THE FAA FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY RESEARCH TEAM, OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, PERFORMED TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING OF SPECIMENS OF THE PILOT.

ANALYSIS OF THE SPECIMENS FOR THE PILOT CONTAINED NO FINDINGS FOR VOLATILES OR TESTED DRUGS. THEY DID NOT PERFORM TESTS FOR CARBON MONOXIDE OR CYANIDE.

TESTS AND RESEARCH

THE FAA, AMERICAN EUROCOPTER, AND HONEYWELL INVESTIGATORS EXAMINED THE WRECKAGE AT PLAIN PARTS, SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA, ON NOVEMBER 18, 2009. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE EXAMINATION FOLLOW; DETAILED NOTES OF THE EXAMINATION ARE PART OF THE PUBLIC DOCKET.

AIRFRAME

INVESTIGATORS DISASSEMBLED THE HYDRAULIC PUMP, AND THE MANUFACTURER REPORTED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE PROPERLY GREASED INSIDE WITH THE SPLINE COUPLING IN GOOD CONDITION.

THE TAIL ROTOR COULD BE ROTATED BY HAND WITH RESULTING ROTATION OF THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX INPUT FLANGE AND REMAINING SHAFT. THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE TRAIN WAS RECONSTRUCTED; SHORT AND LONG TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFTS WERE BUCKLED, AND EXHIBITED ANGULAR AND JAGGED FRACTURE SURFACES. THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE TRAIN FLEX COUPLINGS DID NOT EXHIBIT SIGNIFICANT ROTATIONAL DAMAGE. THE TAIL ROTOR PITCH CHANGE ROD FRACTURE SURFACES WERE BENT AND ANGULAR. MANUAL MOVEMENT OF THE TAIL ROTOR PITCH CHANGE BELLCRANK RESULTED IN APPROPRIATE PITCH CHANGE OF TAIL ROTOR.

A LOCKING PIN (WOODRUFF KEY) IN THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHEARED AND FRACTURED INTO TWO PIECES, AND INVESTIGATORS OBSERVED SOME SMEARING IN THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION. THE FRACTURE SURFACE WAS CONSISTENT WITH OVERLOAD CONDITIONS.

ENGINE EXAM

THE ENGINE WAS EXAMINED AT HONEYWELL FACILITIES IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA, ON DECEMBER 1ST AND 2ND, 2009. PERTINENT PARTS OF THE EXAMINATION FOLLOW; DETAILED EXAMINATION NOTES ARE PART OF THE PUBLIC DOCKET.

ROTATIONAL SIGNATURES

THERE WERE NUMEROUS WITNESS MARKS ON DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THROUGHOUT THE ENGINE.

THE MATCHED IDLER GEAR ASSEMBLY ROTATIONALLY SCORED AN ADJACENT INTERIOR SURFACE OF THE FRONT COVER.

THERE WERE ROTATIONAL WITNESS MARKS ON THE FORWARD FACE OF THE AFT GEAR OF THE MATCHED IDLER GEAR SET.

APPROXIMATELY 18 MARKS (INCREASING IN DEPTH IN THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION) WERE NOTED ON THE AFT GEAR.

CONTACT MARKS WERE ON THE AFT OUTER DIAMETER (OD) CORNERS OF APPROXIMATELY 18 TEETH OF THE POWER OUTPUT GEAR (INCREASING IN MAGNITUDE IN THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION).

ALL LEADING EDGES OF THE AXIAL COMPRESSOR ROTOR BLADES EXHIBITED TEARING AND BATTERING DAMAGE AND WERE BENT OPPOSITE THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION.

ROTATIONAL SCORING WAS ON THE AFT FACE OF THE AXIAL COMPRESSOR ROTOR DISK HUB.

ROTATIONAL SCORING WAS OBSERVED ON ALL OF THE AXIAL COMPRESSOR ROTOR BLADE TIPS.

ROTATIONAL SCORING DAMAGE WAS ON THE FORWARD FACE OF THE COMPRESSOR VANE ASSEMBLY INNER SUPPORT.

ROTATIONAL SCORING WAS EVIDENT TO AN APPROXIMATELY 120-DEGREE SECTION OF THE COMPRESSOR VANE ASSEMBLY BLADE TIP SHROUD (8 – 12 O’CLOCK POSITION, AFT LOOKING FORWARD).

THERE WAS ROTATIONAL SCORING TO THE SHROUD LINE EDGES OF ALL OF THE COMPRESSOR IMPELLER VANES.

ROT","TEN MINUTES AFTER DROPPING OFF A PATIENT AT THE LOCAL HOSPITAL AND WHILE RETURNING TO HOME BASE IN DARK NIGHT CONDITIONS, THE FLIGHT CREW MADE A ROUTINE POSITION REPORT. ABOUT 8 MINUTES LATER, THE FLIGHT CREW TRANSMITTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS GOING DOWN.
 
RADAR DATA INDICATED THAT AFTER DEPARTURE FROM THE HOSPITAL, THE HELICOPTER INITIATED A CLIMB FROM ABOUT 4,500 FEET MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL) AND ESTABLISHED A NORTHWESTERLY COURSE. IN THE VICINITY OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, THE TARGET INDICATED A CLIMBING TURN TO THE NORTHEAST FOLLOWED BY A TURN TO THE SOUTHWEST, AND THEN A CLIMBING TURN BACK TO THE NORTHEAST. THE LAST TWO TARGETS INDICATED A TURN TO THE RIGHT. THE LAST RECORDED ALTITUDE WAS AT 10,200 FEET MSL.

ON-SITE DOCUMENTATION OF THE WRECKAGE SUGGESTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS IN A NOSE-LOW ATTITUDE AND ABOUT A 90-DEGREE BANK ANGLE WHEN IT CONTACTED THE GROUND.
 
A POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE AIRFRAME AND ENGINE REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS OR FAILURES THAT WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED NORMAL OPERATION.

A STUDY OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE VICINITY OF THE ACCIDENT SITE INDICATED CLOUDS WERE PRESENT WITH TOPS REACHING ABOUT 13,000 FEET MSL. LIGHT CLEAR ICING WAS PRESENT WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR MODERATE CLEAR ICING IN OR NEAR CLOUDS. VISIBILITY WAS AT OR GREATER THAN 10 STATUTE MILES.
 
GIVEN THE HELICOPTER’S FLIGHT PATH SHORTLY BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE PILOT WAS MANEUVERING TO AVOID CLOUDS AND BECAME DISORIENTATED IN THE DARK NIGHT CONDITIONS, WHICH RESULTED IN A LOSS OF HELICOPTER CONTROL.","THE PILOT BECAME SPATIALLY DISORIENTED WHILE MANEUVERING ON A DARK NIGHT, WHICH RESULTED IN A LOSS OF HELICOPTER CONTROL."
20100921X14612,1,HUGHES,OH-6A,WPR10LA464,2010,09/11/10 00:00:00,MAJURO,PO,USA,1.0,True,1.0,HUGHES,OH,8.0,HUGHES OH,"ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2010, ABOUT 1500 COORDINATED UNIVERSAL TIME (UTC), A HUGHES OH-6A HELICOPTER, N74LB, SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE FOLLOWING A FORCED LANDING INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN ABOUT 654 MILES SOUTHEAST OF MAJURO, MARSHAL ISLANDS. THE NEW ZEALAND CERTIFICATED HELICOPTER PILOT SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES; THE PASSENGER WAS FATALLY INJURED. THE HELICOPTER WAS OPERATED BY JIM’S AIR REPAIR INC, OF PORT VILLA, VANUATU. THE LOCAL AERIAL OBSERVATION FLIGHT WAS CONDUCTED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS (CFR) PART 91, WHEN THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE FLIGHT, WHICH ORIGINATED FROM A TUNA FISHING VESSEL APPROXIMATELY 55 MINUTES PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.

IN A WRITTEN REPORT TO THE NTSB, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE OPERATOR STATED THAT THE PILOT AND PASSENGER/SPOTTER WERE CONDUCTING FISH SPOTTING DUTIES WHEN THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED. HE REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS IN A CRUISE FLIGHT CONFIGURATION AND OPERATING ABOUT 600 FEET ABOVE THE WATER WHEN THE PILOT FELT A VIBRATION THROUGH THE TAIL ROTOR PEDALS. THE PILOT DESCENDED TO ABOUT 15 FEET ABOVE THE WATER; THE HELICOPTER YAWED RIGHT, CONTACTED THE WATER AND ROLLED UPSIDE-DOWN. THE PILOT AND SPOTTER SUCCESSFULLY EXITED THE HELICOPTER AND WERE LATER RESCUED BY A FISHING VESSEL.

THE SPOTTER REMAINED ONBOARD THE FISHING VESSEL TO CONVALESCE, HOWEVER, DIED THE FOLLOWING DAY AS A RESULT OF INJURIES SUSTAINED DURING THE ACCIDENT SEQUENCE.

THE TAIL BOOM AND TAIL ROTOR ASSEMBLY WERE NOT LOCATED AND PRESUMABLY SANK. SECTIONS OF THE FUSELAGE AND MAIN ROTOR ASSEMBLY WERE RECOVERED AND DISPOSED OF PRIOR TO EXAMINATION BY FAA INSPECTORS. 
 
THE FISH SPOTTER WAS A PHILIPPINE CITIZEN EMPLOYED BY THE TAIWANESE REGISTERED FISHING VESSEL. THE MECHANISM OF HIS INJURIES, DETAILED POSTACCIDENT MEDICAL TREATMENT AND POSTMORTEM INFORMATION WAS NOT AVAILABLE.","ACCORDING TO A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE OPERATOR, THE PILOT AND SPOTTER WERE CONDUCTING FISH-SPOTTING DUTIES, AND THE HELICOPTER WAS IN A CRUISE FLIGHT ABOUT 600 FEET ABOVE THE WATER WHEN THE PILOT FELT A VIBRATION THROUGH THE TAIL ROTOR PEDALS. THE PILOT DESCENDED TO ABOUT 15 FEET ABOVE THE WATER; THE HELICOPTER YAWED RIGHT, CONTACTED THE WATER, AND ROLLED OVER. THE PILOT AND SPOTTER EXITED THE HELICOPTER AND WERE LATER RESCUED BY A FISHING VESSEL; HOWEVER, THE SPOTTER DIED THE FOLLOWING DAY.

ON OCTOBER 15, 2010, AT 1110 CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME, A BELL 206B, N96MP, OPERATED BY THE MISSOURI STATE HIGHWAY PATROL (MSHP), IMPACTED TERRAIN NEAR CLARKSON VALLEY, MISSOURI. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. THE 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS PART 91 FLIGHT WAS NOT OPERATING ON A FLIGHT PLAN. THE PRIVATE PILOT, WHO WAS THE SOLE OCCUPANT, WAS FATALLY INJURED. THE FLIGHT LAST DEPARTED FROM ARNOLD, MISSOURI, ABOUT 1053 AND WAS EN ROUTE TO SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS AIRPORT (SUS), ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.

TWO MSHP TROOPERS ARRIVED AT THE ARNOLD POLICE DEPARTMENT, LOCATED IN ARNOLD, MISSOURI, ABOUT 0845, TO FLY WITH THE PILOT ON A SPEED ENFORCEMENT OPERATION IN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER. THEY SAW THE HELICOPTER APPROACH FROM THE EAST AND LAND IN A FIELD JUST SOUTH OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SHORTLY BEFORE 0900. SHORTLY AFTER 0900, THE FLIGHT DEPARTED FROM THE FIELD AND HEADED TOWARDS INTERSTATE 55. THE TROOPER WHO WAS SEATED IN THE FRONT SEAT STATED THAT WHILE THE HELICOPTER WAS EN ROUTE, HE OBSERVED THAT THE FUEL GAUGE WAS “SLIGHTLY ABOVE 25.” THE TROOPER STATED THAT THE PILOT POINTED TO THE ALTIMETER AND SAID THAT THE ALTITUDE WAS 1,500 FEET. THE TROOPER ALSO STATED THAT THE PILOT SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO “STAY UP AS LONG AS NORMAL” BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE TO OBTAIN FUEL BEFORE HIS NEXT FLIGHT IN FRANKLIN COUNTY AT 1200. AFTER OVER AN HOUR OF FLYING, THE PILOT INFORMED THE TROOPERS THAT HE WOULD PERFORM AN ADDITIONAL SPEED ENFORCEMENT, WHICH WAS COMPLETED ABOUT TWO MINUTES LATER. WHILE RETURNING TO THE ARNOLD POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE TROOPER IN THE FRONT SEAT ASKED THE PILOT HOW LONG IT TOOK TO FLY FROM THE ARNOLD POLICE DEPARTMENT TO ST. LOUIS; THE PILOT REPLIED THAT IT TOOK ABOUT 10 MINUTES. WHEN THE HELICOPTER LANDED, THE TROOPER IN THE FRONT SEAT NOTICED THAT THE FUEL GAUGE INDICATED “HALF WAY BETWEEN E AND 25.” THE PILOT SHUT DOWN THE HELICOPTER, AND THE TWO TROOPERS ABOARD EXITED.

THE FRONT SEAT TROOPER STATED, THAT THROUGHOUT THE FLIGHT, THE PILOT MADE NO STATEMENTS ABOUT THE HELICOPTER NOT RUNNING “PROPERLY.” THE FRONT SEAT TROOPER NOTICED “NO STRANGE OR UNUSUAL NOISES OR ACTIONS” FROM THE HELICOPTER WHEN IT TOOK OFF FOR SUS.

A WITNESS NEAR THE ACCIDENT SITE STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS FLYING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT. HE HEARD THE NOISE OF THE ENGINE “SPUTTER” AND THEN “STOP.” THE ROTOR HAD SEPARATED FROM THE HELICOPTER AND THEY BOTH DESCENDED. THE HELICOPTER FUSELAGE WAS “GYRATING WILDLY” AND “SEEMED OUT OF CONTROL.”

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

THE PILOT’S MEDICAL INFORMATION WAS REVIEWED BY THE MEDICAL OFFICER FOR THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD.

A REVIEW OF THE PILOT’S FAA AEROSPACE MEDICAL CERTIFICATION DIVISION RECORDS REVEALED THAT HIS LAST APPLICATION FOR A SECOND CLASS AIRMAN’S MEDICAL CERTIFICATE WAS MADE ON MAY 27, 2010.  THE PILOT ANSWERED “NO” TO THE QUESTION “DO YOU TAKE ANY MEDICATIONS?”  HE ANSWERED “NO” TO THE QUESTION “MENTAL DISORDERS OF ANY SORT; DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, ETC.”  MEDICAL ISSUES REPORTED BY THE PILOT WERE A KIDNEY STONE IN 1987, HAY FEVER AND ALLERGIES TO “CATS AND GRASS CLIPPINGS.” THE PILOT’S AVIATION MEDICAL EXAMINER FOUND NO ISSUES ON PHYSICAL EXAM OR IN THE PATIENT’S CLINICAL HISTORY THAT WOULD HAVE DISQUALIFIED THE PILOT FOR AN AIRMAN’S MEDICAL CERTIFICATE.  THE SECOND CLASS MEDICAL CERTIFICATE WAS AWARDED ON MAY 27, 2010.

AN AUTOPSY OF THE PILOT WAS PERFORMED BY THE ST. LOUIS COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER’S OFFICE, ON OCTOBER 16, 2010, REVEALED THAT DEATH RESULTED FROM MULTIPLE BLUNT INJURIES TO THE HEAD, NECK, CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND ALL EXTREMITIES.

TESTS AND RESEARCH

ENGINE EXAMINATION:

THE ENGINE UNDERWENT A DISASSEMBLY EXAMINATION AT ROLLS ROYCE, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA, UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF AN FAA INSPECTOR FROM THE INDIANAPOLIS FLIGHT STANDARDS DISTRICT OFFICE. THE INSPECTOR REPORTED THAT THE COMPRESSOR HALVES WERE REMOVED, AND ONE HALF SHOWED A RUB MARK ON THE LINING MATERIAL THAT EXTENDED 40-45 DEGREES OF ROTATION. COMPRESSOR BLADE BENDING WAS ALSO NOTED. THE DAMAGE WAS CONSISTENT WITH ENGINE ROTATION AT THE TIME OF IMPACT. THE NUMBER 1 BEARING ROTATED FREELY AFTER REMOVAL OF THE HOUSING, WHICH HAD SUSTAINED IMPACT DAMAGE. THE CENTRIFUGAL COMPRESSOR SHROUD WAS REMOVED AND RUB MARKS WERE NOTED ON ABOUT 180 DEGREES OF THE SHROUD.

THE TURBINE SECTION WAS SEPARATED AT THE POWER TURBINE SPLIT LINE. THE NUMBER 3 AND 4 TURBINE WHEELS ROTATED FREELY. THERE WERE NO ROTATIONAL MARKS IN THE NUMBER 3 OR 4 BLADE PATHS. THE NUMBER 1 AND 2 TURBINE WHEELS WOULD ROTATE BUT NOT FREELY, WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH CRUSH DAMAGE AT THE AFT END OF THE TURBINE SECTION. THERE WERE NO ROTATION MARKS ON THE NUMBER 2 WHEEL BLADE PATH.

ALL OF THE FUEL NOZZLE SPRAY HOLES APPEARED TO BE OPEN.  

THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO FUEL IN ANY OF THE FUEL LINES FROM THE FUEL CONTROL TO THE FUEL NOZZLE.

COMPONENT EXAMINATION:

THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS WERE SENT TO BELL HELICOPTER, HURST, TEXAS, FOR EXAMINATION UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF AN FAA COS SPECIALIST FROM THE AIRCRAFT CERTIFICATION SERVICE, ROTORCRAFT DIRECTORATE, FORT WORTH, TEXAS: MAST SECTION, YOKE, SPRAG CLUTCH, AND COUPLING.

THE MAST SECTION WAS FRACTURED WELL ABOVE THE SHOULDER ON THE MAST. THE MAST WAS ELONGATED AND POSSESSED SLIGHT BENDING ON THE EXAMINED SECTION. A FRACTURE IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE SPLINED PORTION OF THE TRUNION EXHIBITED A SHEAR FROM OVERLOAD FEATURE. THE MAST AT THE FRACTURE WAS ELONGATED. THE MAST WAS TWISTED AT THE SPLINE.

THE YOKE AND TORSION-TENSION STRAPS WERE EXAMINED AND NO ANOMALIES WERE NOTED.

THE SPRAG CLUTCH HOUSING EXHIBITED IMPACT DAMAGE. THE CLUTCH ROTATED FREELY AND WAS OBSERVED TO CLUTCH AND DECLUTCH. WITNESS MARKS PRESENT ON THE SHAFT WERE CONSISTENT WITH IMPACT DAMAGE. 

THE COUPLING WAS BOUND INTERNALLY DUE TO IMPACT DAMAGE, WHICH PRECLUDED DISASSEMBLY. NO ANOMALIES WERE NOTED.

THE ROTORCRAFT FLYING HANDBOOK (FAA-H-8083-21), CHAPTER 11, LOW G CONDITIONS AND MAST BUMPING, STATES, IN PART, THAT “PUSHING THE CYCLIC CONTROL FORWARD ABRUPTLY FROM EITHER STRAIGHT-AND-LEVEL FLIGHT OR AFTER A CLIMB CAN PUT THE HELICOPTER INTO A LOW G FLIGHT CONDITION.” FIGURE 11-9, STATES, “IN A LOW G CONDITION, IMPROPER CORRECTIVE ACTION COULD LEAD TO THE MAIN ROTOR HUB CONTACTING THE ROTOR MAST. THE CONTACT WITH THE MAST BECOMES MORE VIOLENT WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE FLAPPING MOTION. THIS, IN TURN, CREATES A GREATER FLAPPING DISPLACEMENT. THE RESULT COULD BE A SEVERELY DAMAGED ROTOR MAST, OR THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM COULD SEPARATE FROM THE HELICOPTER.”

MSHP OPERATING PROCEDURES

THE MSHP AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (REVISION 7-2006), II. POLICY AND PROCEDURES, F. USE OF INTOXICANTS AND DRUGS, PARAGRAPHS 2A AND B, STATES:

“CERTAIN DRUGS IN COMMON USE HAVE A MARKED EFFECT ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, WHICH IS TEMPORARILY DETRIMENTAL TO FLIGHT CREW’S FLYING ABILITY. CREWMEMBERS WILL ASK THEIR DOCTOR IF ANY PRESCRIBED DRUG, OR ANY NONPRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS THEY ARE TAKING WILL AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO FUNCTION AS A PILOT. ANY PILOT WHOSE ABILITY TO PILOT AN AIRCRAFT IS AFFECTED BY A DRUG WILL NOT OPERATE PATROL AIRCRAFT.”

“CREW MEMBERS ARE AUTHORIZED AND EXPECTED TO GROUND THEMSELVES WHEN THE POSSIBILITY OF DRUG SIDE EFFECTS EXIST OR WHEN THEY SENSE THAT THEIR PHYSICAL OR MENTAL CONDITION MIGHT AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO PERFORM FLIGHT CREW DUTIES. IN SUCH CASES, A FLIGHT SURGEON WILL BE CONSULTED AND AN ESTIMATED AVAILABILITY DATE FOR RESUMPTION OF FLYING DUTIES WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE MEMBER’S SUPERVISOR AND TO THE DIRECTOR OF AIRCRAFT.”

III. DUTIES, RESPONSIBILITIES, AND QUALIFICATIONS, H. FLIGHT CREW QUALIFICATIONS – GENERAL, PARAGRAPH 2, STATES:

“ALL PILOTS WILL POSSESS AT LEAST A CURRENT SECOND-CLASS MEDICAL CERTIFICATE, WHICH HAS BEEN ISSUED WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE (12) MONTHS. NO PILOT WILL BE ASSIGNED ANY FLIGHT DUTIES DURING A PERIOD OF A KNOWN PHYSICAL DEFICIENCY THAT WOULD RENDER HIM UNABLE TO PASS THE EXAMINATION FOR THIS CERTIFICATE.”

THE MSHP PARTY REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT THE TROOP C COMMAND STAFF, THE DIRECTOR OF THE AIRCRAFT DIVISION, AND ALL PERSONNEL IN THE PILOT’S CHAIN OF COMMAND HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE PILOT’S USE OF THE MEDICATIONS LISTED IN THE FAA FINAL FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY FATAL ACCIDENT REPORT OR HIS MEDICAL CONDITION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR USE.","DURING THE FLIGHT THAT PRECEDED THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT, THE PILOT STATED TO ONE OF THE TWO OFFICERS ABOARD THE HELICOPTER THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FLY FOR AS LONG AS NORMAL BECAUSE HE NEEDED TO OBTAIN FUEL. UPON COMPLETION OF THE OBSERVATION FLIGHT, THE PILOT RETURNED TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND SHUT DOWN THE HELICOPTER TO ALLOW THE TWO OFFICERS TO EXIT. THE PILOT THEN RESTARTED THE HELICOPTER AND DEPARTED EN ROUTE TO AN AIRPORT WHERE HE COULD REFUEL THE HELICOPTER.  A WITNESS NEAR THE ACCIDENT SITE STATED THAT HE HEARD THE HELICOPTER’S ENGINE SPUTTER AND STOP AND SAW THE MAIN ROTOR SEPARATE FROM THE HELICOPTER. THE HELICOPTER ENTERED AN UNCONTROLLED DESCENT AND IMPACTED TERRAIN.

POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER REVEALED THAT THERE WAS NO USABLE FUEL ON BOARD AND THAT THE MAIN ROTOR MAST SEPARATED AS A RESULT OF OVERLOAD DUE TO MAST BUMPING (MAIN ROTOR HUB TO ROTOR MAST CONTACT).  NO PREIMPACT MECHANICAL ANOMALIES THAT WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED NORMAL OPERATION OF THE HELICOPTER WERE NOTED. MAST BUMPING TYPICALLY RESULTS FROM A LOW-G FLIGHT CONDITION CAUSED BY THE PILOT PUSHING THE CYCLIC CONTROL FORWARD ABRUPTLY FROM EITHER STRAIGHT-AND-LEVEL FLIGHT OR AFTER A CLIMB. PUSHING THE CYCLIC FORWARD ABRUPTLY IS CONTRARY TO THE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS FOR ENTERING AN AUTOROTATION, WHICH ARE LOWERING THE COLLECTIVE PITCH CONTROL TO THE FULL DOWN POSITION, ADDING ANTITORQUE PEDAL AS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN HEADING, AND APPLYING CYCLIC AS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN PROPER AIRSPEED.

REVIEW OF THE PILOT’S MEDICAL RECORDS INDICATED THAT HE HAD A HISTORY OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA. EACH OF THESE CONDITIONS HAD BEEN DOCUMENTED AND TREATED SINCE 2007, AND NONE WERE REPORTED TO THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) ON THE PILOT’S AIRMAN MEDICAL APPLICATION IN 2010 OR EARLIER. ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS MAY HAVE DISQUALIFIED THE PILOT FROM OBTAINING AN AIRMAN’S MEDICAL CERTIFICATE. POSTMORTEM TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING INDICATED THAT THE PILOT WAS TAKING ALPRAZOLAM, AN ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION, AND VENLAFAXINE, AN ANTI-DEPRESSANT. ALPRAZOLAM IS ONE OF A CLASS OF DRUGS WHICH MAY WORSEN OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA, AND VENLAFAXINE CAN CAUSE FATIGUE AND DIZZINESS. THE FACT THAT THE BLOOD LEVEL OF VENLAFAXINE FOUND WAS HIGHER THAN NORMAL THERAPEUTIC LEVELS MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE SIDE EFFECT OF DIZZINESS OCCURRED AND IMPAIRED THE PILOT’S PERFORMANCE.","THE TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DUE TO FUEL EXHAUSTION, WHICH RESULTED FROM THE PILOT'S INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT PLANNING AND DECISION-MAKING, AND HIS IMPROPER CONTROL INPUTS FOLLOWING THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER, WHICH RESULTED IN MAST BUMPING AND SEPARATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR. CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S IMPROPER JUDGMENT IN ACTING AS A PILOT WITH DISQUALIFYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS."

ON OCTOBER 30, 2010, ABOUT 1030 EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME, AN MD HELICOPTERS, INC. 369E, N765WH, OPERATED BY WINCO, INC., WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED WHEN IT COLLIDED WITH POWER TRANSMISSION WIRES AND TERRAIN WHILE PERFORMING EXTERNAL-LOAD/LINE-MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS NEAR THOMAS, WEST VIRGINIA. THE CERTIFICATED COMMERCIAL PILOT WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED. OF THE THREE LINEMEN ON BOARD, TWO SUFFERED MINOR INJURIES WHILE ONE WAS FATALLY INJURED. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED, AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE LOCAL EXTERNAL LOAD FLIGHT, WHICH WAS CONDUCTED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS PART 133. 

THE PILOT AND BOTH SURVIVING LINEMEN RECOUNTED A SIMILAR SERIES OF EVENTS DURING SEPARATE POST-ACCIDENT INTERVIEWS.

ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, THE HELICOPTER WAS TASKED WITH TRANSPORTING FOUR LINEMEN BETWEEN SEVERAL POWER TRANSMISSION TOWERS SO THAT THEY COULD TRANSFER FIBER OPTIC GROUNDING LINES FROM PULLEYS USED DURING THEIR INSTALLATION, TO THEIR FINAL FIXED LOCATION ON THE TOWER. THE CREW BEGAN THEIR WORK AT 0820 THAT MORNING BY TRANSPORTING TWO OF THE LINEMEN TO TRANSMISSION TOWER NUMBER 242, AND HAD PROGRESSED SEQUENTIALLY, MY MOVING GROUPS OF TWO LINEMEN AT A TIME, TO THE FINAL TOWER FOR THIS PORTION OF THE OPERATION, NUMBER 248. 

ON EACH OF THE SEVEN TOWERS WORKED ON THAT DAY, THE SAME PROCEDURE WAS USED TO DROP OFF THE LINEMAN TO PERFORM THE WORK. THE HELICOPTER HOVERED NEAR THE TRANSMISSION TOWER'S PEAK, WHILE THE LINEMEN DISEMBARKED THE HELICOPTER, THEN AFTER THE HELICOPTER ASCENDED VERTICALLY APPROXIMATELY 40 FEET, THE LINEMEN RETRIEVED THEIR EQUIPMENT FROM THE END OF A SLING SUSPENDED 40 FEET BELOW THE HELICOPTER, AND THEN BEGAN THEIR WORK. WHEN THE WORK WAS COMPLETE, THE LINEMAN WOULD CALL THE HELICOPTER VIA RADIO, AND IT WOULD RETURN TO PICK UP THE LINEMEN AND THEIR EQUIPMENT USING THE EXACT OPPOSITE PROCEDURE. THE LINEMEN WOULD FIRST LOAD THEIR EQUIPMENT ONTO THE SLING, AND THEN THE HELICOPTER WOULD DESCEND SO THAT THE LINEMEN COULD RE-BOARD THE HELICOPTER WHILE IT HOVERED ADJACENT TO THE TRANSMISSION TOWER'S PEAK, ABOUT 100 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL. THE PROCEDURE OF TRANSFERRING THE LINEMEN AND THEIR TOOLS TO OR FROM A TRANSMISSION TOWER HAD BEEN EXECUTED 32 TIMES ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT. THESE OPERATIONS WERE CONDUCTED IDENTICALLY EACH TIME, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THIRD LINEMAN THAT WAS CARRIED ON THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT. THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT WAS TO BE THE FINAL TRANSFER OF THE DAY.

TWO LINEMEN WERE ASSIGNED TO EACH TOWER, BUT ONE OF THE LINEMEN WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY FINISHING HIS WORK ON TOWER 248, SO THE HELICOPTER TRANSPORTED ANOTHER LINEMAN TO THE TOWER TO ASSIST HIM. AFTER ALL THREE LINEMEN HAD COMPLETED THEIR WORK ON TOWER 248, THE HELICOPTER RETURNED TO RETRIEVE THEM AND THEIR EQUIPMENT. WHILE MOVING FROM TOWER TO TOWER, THE LINEMAN WERE EITHER SEATED IN THE HELICOPTER OR TETHERED TO THE HELICOPTER WHILE STANDING ON THE HELICOPTER'S LEFT SKID. THEIR EQUIPMENT WAS THEN CARRIED AT THE END OF A 40-FOOT SLING SUSPENDED BELOW THE HELICOPTER. 

AFTER THE LINEMAN WHO WAS LOCATED AT THE NORTH PEAK OF TOWER 248 COMPLETED HIS WORK, HIS EQUIPMENT WAS LOADED ON TO A THREE PRONG GRAPPLING HOOK, SUSPENDED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SLING, THEN THE HELICOPTER DESCENDED AND THE LINEMAN BOARDED THE HELICOPTER. THE PILOT THEN CLIMBED THE HELICOPTER VERTICALLY, CLEARED THE SUSPENDED LOAD FROM THE TOWER, AND POSITIONED THE HELICOPTER 40 FEET ABOVE THE PEAK ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE TOWER. AFTER LOADING THE LINEMEN’S EQUIPMENT THE HELICOPTER DESCENDED TO THE PEAK TO PICK UP THE TWO LINEMEN FROM THAT PEAK. TWO OF THE LINEMEN WERE SEATED IN THE REAR OF THE HELICOPTER, WHILE THE THIRD LINEMAN WAS STANDING ON THE HELICOPTER'S LEFT SKID.  

THE PILOT STATED THAT AFTER THE LINEMEN BOARDED, HE ""CLEARED"" THE TOWER AND MOVED THE HELICOPTER FORWARD. HE COULD NOT RECALL THE HELICOPTER'S ALTITUDE ABOVE THE TOWER, BUT REMEMBERED THAT THE HELICOPTER BEGAN ""SHAKING WITH A LARGE VIBRATION."" HE STRUGGLED WITH THE CYCLIC CONTROL, FELT THE HELICOPTER ""HIT SOMETHING"" BEFORE IT BEGAN ""SPINNING."" HE REMEMBERED PULLING UP ON THE COLLECTIVE PITCH, IMPACTING THE GROUND, AND THEN MOVING THE THROTTLE TO THE ""OFF"" POSITION.

ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE LINEMEN, AFTER ALL THREE HAD BOARDED, ""…THE HELICOPTER PULLED AWAY [FROM THE TOWER]. THE WHOLE HELICOPTER THEN PAUSED AND AFTER THAT STARTED SHAKING PRIOR TO IMPACTING THE GROUND."" THE OTHER LINEMAN STATED THAT INSTEAD OF BACKING UP AND AWAY FROM THE TOWER AS HE EXPECTED, THE PILOT ""PICKED UP AND POWERED INTO IT."" THE LINEMAN FURTHER STATED THAT HE FELT A ""PAUSE"" AND THE ENGINE ""BOGGED DOWN.""

DURING THE IMPACT SEQUENCE, ONE OF THE LINEMEN, WHO WAS SITTING IN THE HELICOPTER BUT NOT TETHERED TO IT, WAS THROWN CLEAR AND SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES. THE OTHER SURVIVING LINEMAN WAS ALSO SEATED IN THE AFT CABIN OF THE HELICOPTER, BUT REMAINED TETHERED TO THE SAFETY HOOK, AND ALSO SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES. THE LINEMAN STANDING ON THE HELICOPTERS SKID, WHO WAS ALSO TETHERED TO THE SAFETY HOOK, WAS FATALLY INJURED DURING THE IMPACT SEQUENCE.

WHEN ASKED, THE PILOT COULD NOT RECALL ATTEMPTING TO JETTISON THE EXTERNAL LOAD AT ANY POINT DURING THE ACCIDENT SEQUENCE.

PERSONNEL INFORMATION

ACCORDING TO RECORDS PROVIDED BY THE OPERATOR, THE PILOT HELD A COMMERCIAL PILOT CERTIFICATE WITH A RATING FOR ROTORCRAFT-HELICOPTER. THE PILOT HAD ACCUMULATED 1,682 TOTAL HOURS OF FLIGHT EXPERIENCE, ALL OF WHICH WERE IN ROTORCRAFT, AND 282 HOURS OF WHICH WERE IN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER MAKE AND MODEL. THE PILOT'S MOST RECENT FAA SECOND-CLASS MEDICAL CERTIFICATE WAS ISSUED ON FEBRUARY 15, 2010, WITH THE LIMITATION ""MUST WEAR CORRECTIVE LENSES.""

THE PILOT COMPLETED 4.6 HOURS OF EXTERNAL LOAD AND VERTICAL REFERENCE TRAINING AT A THIRD PARTY FACILITY ON APRIL 28, 2010. ONCE EMPLOYED BY THE OPERATOR, THE PILOT COMPLETED 18.7 FLIGHT HOURS OF “INITIAL TRAINING”. OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS THE PILOT RECEIVED 434.7 FLIGHT HOURS OF “ON THE JOB TRAINING” WITH MORE EXPERIENCED COMPANY PILOTS, INCLUDING 126.5 FLIGHT HOURS PERFORMING THE OPERATION THAT WAS BEING PERFORMED AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. ON OCTOBER 27, 2010, THE PILOT WAS CERTIFIED BY THE OPERATOR AS PROFICIENT IN OPERATIONS THAT INCLUDED: APPROACH TO, OPERATIONS AT, AND DEPARTURE FROM A STRUCTURE; APPROACH TO, TRANSFER LINEMAN ON/OFF, AND DEPARTURE FROM A STRUCTURE, AND HELICOPTER EXTERNAL LOAD OPERATIONS.

HELICOPTER INFORMATION

ACCORDING TO MAINTENANCE RECORDS SUPPLIED BY THE OPERATOR, THE HELICOPTER WAS MANUFACTURED IN 2009 AND ITS AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATE WAS ISSUED ON DECEMBER 7, 2009. THE HELICOPTER'S MOST RECENT 100 HOUR INSPECTION WAS COMPLETED ON OCTOBER 23, 2010 AT 392 TOTAL HELICOPTER HOURS.

THE HELICOPTER WAS EQUIPPED WITH SEVERAL MISSION-RELATED MODIFICATIONS FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF POWER LINE CONSTRUCTION/MAINTENANCE. THESE MODIFICATIONS INCLUDED (BUT WERE NOT LIMITED TO), A SAFETY HARNESS ATTACHMENT POINT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HELICOPTER FOR THE LINEMEN, A DECK PLATE TO FACILITATE BOARDING THE HELICOPTER, AND AN EXTERNAL CARGO HOOK. THE CARGO HOOK FEATURED ELECTRIC AND MANUAL RELEASE SYSTEMS, BOTH OF WHICH WERE LOCATED ON THE CYCLIC CONTROL. A 40-FOOT SYNTHETIC FIBER-ROPE SLING (RED IN COLOR) ATTACHED TO THE CARGO HOOK WAS USED TO FERRY THE LINEMEN'S EQUIPMENT FROM SITE TO SITE. THE SLING WAS EQUIPPED WITH A CUSTOM-MADE, 3-PRONG GRAPPLING HOOK, WHICH WAS FABRICATED BY THE OPERATOR.

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

AT 1051 THE WEATHER REPORTED AT ELKINS-RANDOLPH COUNTY AIRPORT (EKN), LOCATED 24 NAUTICAL MILES SOUTHWEST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, INCLUDED CLEAR SKIES, 10 STATUTE MILES VISIBILITY, CALM WINDS, TEMPERATURE 5 DEGREES C, DEWPOINT 0 DEGREES C, AND AN ALTIMETER SETTING OF 30.13 INCHES OF MERCURY.

THE PILOT STATED THAT THE WEATHER AT THE ACCIDENT SITE INCLUDED CALM WINDS, WITH NO GUSTS OR CROSSWINDS. THE TEMPERATURE WAS ""COLD"" AND THE SKY WAS ""SUNNY.""

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER, ITS ASSOCIATED COMPONENTS, WITH CARGO SLING ATTACHED CAME TO REST ON THE WEST SIDE OF TOWER 248. A BROKEN SECTION OF SLING WITH GRAPPLING HOOK AND LINEMAN EQUIPMENT ATTACHED CAME TO REST NEAR THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE TOWER'S BASE. TERRAIN ELEVATION AT THE BASE OF THE TOWER WAS 2,598 FEET, AND THE TOWER WAS 100 FEET-TALL. THE POWER TRANSMISSION LINES WERE ARRANGED ALONG THE TOP OF THE TOWER IN THREE GROUPS OF THREE CONDUCTORS EACH. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH OF THE THREE INDIVIDUAL CONDUCTORS WAS 14 INCHES. GROUNDING FIBERS WERE LOCATED AT THE NORTH AND SOUTH PEAKS OF THE TOWERS. ALL OF THE TRANSMISSION LINES AND BOTH GROUNDING FIBERS WERE SUSPENDED FROM THE TOWER IN ROUGHLY AN EAST-WEST ORIENTATION. 

THE FUSELAGE OF THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST ABOUT 100 FEET WEST OF THE TRANSMISSION TOWER, LYING ON ITS LEFT SIDE AND ORIENTED 360 DEGREES MAGNETIC. THE TAIL BOOM WAS SEPARATED FROM THE FUSELAGE AT A POINT ABOUT 2 FEET FORWARD OF THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX. THE SEPARATED PORTION OF THE TAIL, WHICH INCLUDED THE INTACT TAIL-ROTOR WAS FOUND 58 FEET WEST OF THE TOWER, BETWEEN THE TOWER AND THE FUSELAGE.

THE VERTICAL STABILIZER EXHIBITED TWO PARALLEL CONCAVE DEPRESSIONS, LOCATED ABOUT 14 INCHES APART. CONTACT MARKS CONSISTENT IN SIZE AND ORIENTATION OF THE TRANSMISSION LINE WIRE STRANDS WERE OBSERVED ALONG THE INTERIOR OF BOTH DEPRESSIONS. BOTH TAIL ROTOR BLADES EXHIBITED CONCAVE DEPRESSIONS THAT ROUGHLY CORRESPONDED TO THE POSITION OF THE LOWER MOST CONTACT MARK ON THE VERTICAL STABILIZER AND ALSO EXHIBITED SIMILAR WIRE CONTACT SIGNATURES. EXAMINATION OF ALL THREE CONDUCTORS GROUPED NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE TOWER REVEALED CONTACT MARKS EXHIBITING DAMAGE AND PAINT TRANSFER CONSISTENT WITH CONTACT BETWEEN THE CONDUCTORS AND BOTH THE VERTICAL STABILIZER AND TAIL ROTOR BLADES. THE TIP OF ONE TAIL-ROTOR BLADE WAS SEPARATED, AND FOUND ABOUT 100 FEET NORTH OF THE TAIL ROTOR.

ALL FIVE MAIN ROTOR BLADE GRIPS WERE SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN ROTOR HUB AT THE STRAP PACKS, AND EACH MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS FURTHER SEPARATED FROM ITS RESPECTIVE BLADE GRIP AT THE ROOT. THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE DISTRIBUTED ABOUT THE ACCIDENT SCENE IN AN ARC THAT RANGED FROM THE SOUTHWEST TO NORTHWEST OF THE FUSELAGE. ALL OF THE BLADES EXHIBITED SIGNATURES CONSISTENT WITH GROUND CONTACT, AND ONE BLADE WAS BROKEN INTO THREE ROUGHLY EQUAL PORTIONS.

CONTROL CONTINUITY WAS TRACED FROM THE FLIGHT CONTROLS TO THE CYCLIC AND COLLECTIVE PITCH LINKS, PITCH HOUSINGS, AND MAIN ROTOR BLADE STRAPS, WHICH WERE FRACTURED AT THE MAIN ROTOR HUB. THE SCISSORS LINK WAS FRACTURED THROUGH THE MID-SECTION AND THE ROTATING SWASHPLATE AND SCISSORS CRANK WERE NOT FRACTURED. NO DAMAGE WAS NOTED TO THE SECONDARY SWASHPLATE. THE ROTATING SWASHPLATE WAS REMOVED AND THE SWASHPLATE BEARING AND SPHERICAL BEARING INSPECTED. THE SWASHPLATE'S SPHERICAL BEARING WAS FREE TO MOVE VERTICALLY ABOUT 0.016-INCH. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ROTATION BETWEEN THE SPHERICAL BEARING RACE AND THE DOUBLE ROW BALL BEARING RACE.

TAIL ROTOR CONTROL CONTINUITY WAS TRACED FROM THE CONTROL PEDALS THROUGH THE FRACTURE IN THE TAIL BOOM, TO THE TAIL ROTOR PITCH CHANGE LINKS, WHICH REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE TAIL-ROTOR. MAIN ROTOR DRIVE CONTINUITY WAS VERIFIED FROM THE ENGINE N2 AND OVERRIDING CLUTCH TO THE MAIN ROTOR. TAIL ROTOR DRIVE CONTINUITY WAS VERIFIED FROM THE MAIN TRANSMISSION THROUGH FOUR FRACTURES IN THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVESHAFT TO THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX. THE AFT-MOST BREAK OF THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVESHAFT DISPLAYED TORSIONAL FRACTURE SIGNATURES.

ALL ENGINE MOUNTS REMAINED SECURE EXCEPT THE RIGHT FRONT, WHICH SEPARATED FROM THE AIRFRAME. THE ENGINE N1 AND N2 SYSTEMS TURNED FREELY AND WERE CONTINUOUS TO THE STARTER AND MAIN ROTOR, RESPECTIVELY. DAMAGE TO THE FIRST STAGE COMPRESSOR BLADES WAS NOTED CONSISTENT WITH FOREIGN OBJECT INGESTION. FUEL WAS NOTED IN THE LINE TO THE FUEL NOZZLE, AND THE NOZZLE WAS ABSENT OF OBSTRUCTION. THE UPPER AND LOWER MAGNETIC CHIP DETECTORS WERE ABSENT OF CONTAMINATION. 

A 27-FOOT LENGTH OF THE RED-COLORED, EXTERNAL-LOAD SLING REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE HELICOPTER'S CARGO HOOK. THE REMAINING 13 FEET OF SLING, WITH GRAPPLING HOOK ATTACHED, WAS LOCATED AT THE BASE OF THE TOWER. THE EQUIPMENT USED BY THE LINEMEN FOR THEIR WORK ON THE TOWER REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE GRAPPLING HOOK VIA STRAPS. ONE OF THE THREE PRONGS OF THE GRAPPLING HOOK WAS BENT SLIGHTLY INWARD, TOWARDS THE CENTER SHAFT OF THE HOOK. TESTING OF THE HELICOPTER'S EXTERNAL CARGO HOOK REVEALED THAT BOTH THE ELECTRICAL AND MANUAL RELEASE SYSTEMS FUNCTIONED NORMALLY.

EXAMINATION OF THE TRANSMISSION TOWER REVEALED SEVERAL RED-COLORED FIBER TRANSFER MARKS ALONG THE TOP SPAN OF THE TRANSMISSION TOWER. SEVERAL ABRASIONS AND GOUGES OF THE TOWER'S STRUCTURE WERE NOTED ABOUT 16 FEET BELOW THE FIBER TRANSFER MARKS. LINEMEN PERFORMING A POST-ACCIDENT INSPECTION OF THE TOWER, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF A SAFETY BOARD INVESTIGATOR, SUSPENDED THE SEPARATED LOWER PORTION OF THE SLING AND GRAPPLING HOOK FROM THE TOWER AT THE POINT WHERE THE FIBER TRANSFER MARKS WERE OBSERVED, WHICH PLACED THE GRAPPLING HOOK DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THE ABRASIONS ON THE TOWER STRUCTURE.

TESTS AND RESEARCH

A HAND-HELD GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) RECEIVER WAS RECOVERED FROM THE WRECKAGE AND FORWARDED TO THE SAFETY BOARD'S VEHICLE RECORDERS LABORATORY FOR DATA EXTRACTION. DOWNLOAD OF THE DATA SHOWED THAT ACCIDENT FLIGHT WAS APPROXIMATELY 2 HOURS AND 53 MINUTES IN DURATION. THE FIRST DATA POINT WAS RECORDED AT 0737:09. FOR APPROXIMATELY THE FIRST 19 MINUTES OF FLIGHT FROM 0737 TO 0756, THE HELICOPTER HEADED IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION. AT 0756:00, THE HELICOPTER WAS APPROXIMATELY 30 MILES FROM THE START OF THE FLIGHT AND FOR THE REMAINING DATA (FROM 0756:00 TO 1030:20), THE HELICOPTER MOVED FROM WEST TO EAST AND THEN BACK AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES WHILE COVERING A 3-MILE AREA.

NEAR THE END OF THE DATA FROM 1025:12 TO 1030:10, THE HELICOPTER REMAINED WITHIN A 0.2 MILE AREA WHILE THE GPS ALTITUDE STAYED BETWEEN 2,700 FEET TO 2,800 FEET AND THE GROUND SPEED REMAINED UNDER 3 MPH AND WENT AS LOW AS 0.1 MPH. AT 1030:10, THE HELICOPTER WAS AT A GPS ALTITUDE OF 2,708 FEET WITH A GROUND SPEED OF 0.1 MPH AND FIVE SECONDS LATER AT 1030:15, THE GROUND SPEED INCREASED TO 5 MPH WHILE THE GPS ALTITUDE SLIGHTLY DECREASED TO 2,702 FEET. FIVE SECONDS LATER, AT THE LAST DATA POINT, THE GROUND SPEED INCREASED TO 6 MPH AND THE GPS ALTITUDE DECREASED TO 2,601 FEET.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

THE OPERATOR DEVELOPED TASK ANALYSIS DOCUMENTS THAT SPECIFIED THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PILOT AND OTHER PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE OPERATOR'S UNIQUE WORK. TASK ANALYSIS 002, ""APPROACH TO, TRANSFER LINEMAN ON/OFF AND DEPARTURES FROM A STRUCTURE"", PROCEDURE ""H. DEPARTURE FROM THE STRUCTURE"" DEFINED THE POTENTIAL OPERATIONAL RISKS DURING THIS PHASE OF THE TASK AS; OBSTACLE CLEARANCE, HELICOPTER PERFORMANCE WITH ADDITIONAL WEIGHT, HELICOPTER RESTRAINED BY BOND OR SAFETY CONNECTIONS, OR HELICOPTER MALFUNCTION. THE RECOMMENDED RISK REDUCTION PROCEDURE FOR THIS PHASE OF TASK STATED: ""THE PILOT SHALL BE COGNIZANT OF EMERGENCY PROCEDURES AND PLANS AT ALL TIMES. THE LINEMAN SHALL INSURE ALL OBJECTS, (BONDING, PERSONAL SAFETY GEAR AND ETC) ARE CLEAR BETWEEN THE HELICOPTER AND THE STRUCTURE. THE LINEMAN SHALL COMMUNICATE, 'CLEAR TO LEAVE' WHEN APPROPRIATE. THE PILOT WILL ASSURE: RIGHT-OF-WAY CLEARANCE, STRUCTURE CLEARANCE, WIND DIRECTION AND VELOCITY, GROSS WEIGHT, POWER AVAILABLE, AND LINEMAN AND EQUIPMENT ARE STOWED AND SECURED. THE PILOT SHALL RESPOND, 'LEAVING STRUCTURE' WHEN APPROPRIATE. THE DEPARTURE SHALL BE PERFORMED IN A SLOW AND DELIBERATE MANNER. THE PILOT AND LINEMAN SHALL VERIFY THAT THE HELICOPTER IS CLEAR TO CONTINUE DEPARTURE."" THE EMERGENCY PROCEDURE FOR THIS PHASE OF THE TASK ADVISED THE PILOT TO PERFORMED HELICOPTER EMERGENCY PROCEDURES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ROTORCRAFT FLIGHT MANUAL, AND SPECIFICALLY ADVISED, ""INADVERTENT ATTACHMENT TO THE STRUCTURE MAY BE RECTIFIED BY SLOWLY MOVING THE HELICOPTER BACK TO THE WORK LOCATION.""

THE OPERATORS TASK ANALYSIS 009, ""HELICOPTER EXTERNAL LOAD"", SIMILARLY DEFINED THE PROCEDURES WHEN WORKING WITH LOADS ATTACHED TO THE HELICOPTER'S EXTERIOR. UND","THE PILOT TRANSITIONED THE HELICOPTER TO PICK UP THREE LINEMEN WHO WERE WORKING FROM THE PEAK OF A 100-FOOT-TALL TRANSMISSION TOWER. BEFORE THE LINEMEN BOARDED THE HELICOPTER (TWO WERE IN THE HELICOPTER AND ONE WAS ON THE SKID), THEY SECURED THEIR EQUIPMENT TO THE EXTERNAL LOAD GRAPPLING HOOK SUSPENDED 50 FEET BELOW THE HELICOPTER. THE PILOT POSITIONED THE HELICOPTER ADJACENT TO THE TOWER STRUCTURE BETWEEN THE TWO SETS OF ELECTRICAL CONDUCTORS, WITH THE GRAPPLING HOOK AND THE LINEMEN'S EQUIPMENT SUSPENDED BELOW. AS THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO MANEUVER THE HELICOPTER CLEAR OF THE TOWER, IT PAUSED, AND THEN BEGAN TO SHAKE BEFORE THE HELICOPTER CONTACTED WIRES ON THE OPPOSITE END OF THE TOWER AND IMPACTED THE GROUND UNDER POWER. BOTH OF THE LINEMEN WHO WERE SEATED IN THE HELICOPTER BEFORE IT IMPACTED THE GROUND INCURRED MINOR INJURIES; THE LINEMAN STANDING ON THE HELICOPTER'S SKID WAS FATALLY INJURED. THE PILOT DID NOT ATTEMPT TO RELEASE THE EXTERNAL LOAD AT ANY POINT DURING THE ACCIDENT SEQUENCE, AND POSTACCIDENT TESTING OF THE SYSTEM REVEALED NO ANOMALIES. POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE AIRFRAME AND ENGINE REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF ANY PREIMPACT MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS OR FAILURES OF THE HELICOPTER. EXAMINATION OF THE POWER TRANSMISSION TOWER AND EXTERNAL-LOAD SLING REVEALED EVIDENCE CONSISTENT WITH ENTANGLEMENT OF THE EXTERNAL LOAD WITH THE TOWER'S STRUCTURE. IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE WITH THE OPERATOR'S RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE OF JETTISONING THE EXTERNAL LOAD IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY (ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED) WOULD HAVE PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PILOT TO HAVE PREVENTED THE ACCIDENT.","THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO CLEAR THE HELICOPTER AND ITS EXTERNAL LOAD FROM SURROUNDING STRUCTURES AND HIS FAILURE TO EXECUTE A TIMELY RELEASE OF THE EXTERNAL LOAD, WHICH RESULTED IN AN INADVERTENT ENTANGLEMENT AND COLLISION WITH WIRES AND TERRAIN. CONTRIBUTING TO THE LINEMAN'S FATAL INJURY WAS HIS POSITION OUTSIDE OF THE HELICOPTER DURING THE ACCIDENT."

ON JUNE 27, 2011, AT 1223 CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME, A ROBINSON R22 BETA HELICOPTER, N7779M, STRUCK TREES AND IMPACTED TERRAIN NEAR DEL VALLE, TEXAS. THE PILOT, THE SOLE OCCUPANT ON BOARD, WAS FATALLY INJURED. THE HELICOPTER WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED AND A POST-IMPACT FIRE ENSUED. THE HELICOPTER WAS REGISTERED TO AND OPERATED BY THE OPERATOR UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS PART 91 AS A PERSONAL FLIGHT. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, AND NO FLIGHT PLAN HAD BEEN FILED. THE CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT ORIGINATED FROM TAYLOR (T74), TEXAS, ABOUT 1205, AND WAS EN ROUTE TO LULING, TEXAS.

ACCORDING TO THE OWNER, THE PILOT WAS EN ROUTE TO LULING TO GIVE A FRIEND HIS FIRST HELICOPTER RIDE. THERE WERE TWO WITNESSES STANDING ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE COLORADO RIVER. THEY SAID THE HELICOPTER WAS FLYING NORTH TO SOUTH JUST ABOVE THE TREES. AS IT CROSSED THE COLORADO RIVER, THEY HEARD A LOUD ""POP"" OR ""BANG"" AND SAW SOMETHING SEPARATE FROM THE HELICOPTER AND FALL INTO THE RIVER. ASKED IF THE OBJECT FLOATED OR SANK, THE WITNESSES SAID THEY DID NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION BECAUSE WHEN THEY HEARD THE HELICOPTER CRASH AND SAW THE SMOKE, THEY RAN TO THE CRASH SITE.


PERSONNEL (CREW) INFORMATION

THE PILOT, AGE 60, HELD A PRIVATE PILOT CERTIFICATE WITH AIRPLANE SINGLE/MULTIENGINE LAND, INSTRUMENT-AIRPLANE, AND ROTORCRAFT-HELICOPTER RATINGS. HIS SECOND CLASS AIRMAN MEDICAL CERTIFICATE, DATED OCTOBER 2, 2009, CONTAINED THE RESTRICTION: “MUST WEAR CORRECTIVE LENSES AND POSSESS GLASSES FOR NEAR AND INTERMEDIATE VISION.” ACCORDING TO THE OPERATOR, THE PILOT HAD ACCRUED APPROXIMATELY 220 HELICOPTER FLIGHT HOURS, ALL OF WHICH WERE IN THE ROBINSON R22. IN THE PAST 90 AND 30 DAYS, HE HAD LOGGED 15 HOURS AND 3 HOURS, RESPECTIVELY. HIS LAST FLIGHT REVIEW WAS DATED AUGUST 27, 2010.


AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

N7779M (SERIAL NUMBER 1229), A MODEL R22 BETA, WAS MANUFACTURED BY THE ROBINSON HELICOPTER CORPORATION IN 1989. IT WAS POWERED BY A LYCOMING O-320-B2C ENGINE (SERIAL NUMBER L-15943-39A), RATED AT 131 HORSEPOWER.

THE HELICOPTER HAD BEEN OPERATED IN JAPAN, AND WAS PURCHASED BY THE OWNER IN 1999. ACCORDING TO THE MAINTENANCE RECORDS, THE ENGINE WAS OVERHAULED ON OCTOBER 14, 2010. IN ADDITION, THE HELICOPTER UNDERWENT A 2,200-HOUR OVERHAUL ON DECEMBER 30, 2010. BOTH OVERHAULS OCCURRED AT AN AIRFRAME AND TACHOMETER TOTAL TIME OF 2,294.8 HOURS. DURING THE AIRFRAME OVERHAUL, THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS WERE REPLACED WITH NEW OR FACTORY-OVERHAULED COMPONENTS: MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX, SWASHPLATE, GEARSET, HUB, DRIVESHAFT, CLUTCH SHAFT, BEARING ASSEMBLY, AND SPRAG CLUTCH; TAIL ROTOR BLADES, HUB, GEARBOX, PITCH CONTROL, ACTUATOR ASSEMBLY, AND DRIVE SHAFT; TAILCONE ASSEMBLY, HORIZONTAL STABILIZER, AND WELDED FRAME. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE AIRFRAME AND ENGINE OVERHAULS, AN ANNUAL INSPECTION WAS ACCOMPLISHED AT WHICH TIME THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE REPLACED AS SUGGESTED BY THE MANUFACTURER’S SERVICE BULLETIN.


METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

THE FOLLOWING WEATHER OBSERVATION WAS RECORDED AT AUSTIN-BERGSTROM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (KAUS), AUSTIN, TEXAS, AT 1153:

WIND, 190 DEGREES AT 12 KNOTS, GUSTING TO 19 KNOTS; VISIBILITY, 10 STATUTE MILES; SKY CONDITION, 3,600 FEET SCATTERED; TEMPERATURE, 34 DEGREES C.; DEW POINT, 22 DEGREES C.; ALTIMETER, 29.93 INCHES OF MERCURY.


WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED TREES AND TERRAIN ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE COLORADO RIVER. THE BURNT WRECKAGE WAS AT THE BASE OF A LARGE TREE. A PIECE OF TAIL BOOM SKIN WAS IN THE TREE. ONE MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS FOUND APPROXIMATELY 780 FEET FROM THE WRECKAGE. THE OTHER MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS FOUND APPROXIMATELY 975 FEET FROM THE WRECKAGE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BOTH BLADES WERE INTACT WITH NO LEADING EDGE DAMAGE. 

BECAUSE THE WITNESSES SAID THEY HAD SEEN SOMETHING FALL FROM THE HELICOPTER, THE RIVER WAS SEARCHED AND DRAGGED BY THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY. NOTHING WAS FOUND OR RECOVERED. THE HEAD OF ONE BOLT THAT ATTACHED ONE OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES TO THE HUB, AND THE NUT AND SHANK PORTION OF THE OTHER BOLT THAT ATTACHED THE SECOND MAIN ROTOR BLADE WERE RECOVERED. MISSING WAS THE HEAD OF THE SECOND BOLT AND THE NUT AND SHANK PORTION OF THE FIRST BOLT.  EFFECTIVELY, ONLY PARTS FROM TWO DIFFERENT BOLTS WERE RECOVERED. EXAMINATION OF THE REMAINDER OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED NO OTHER MISSING COMPONENTS.


MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

AUTOPSY AND TOXICOLOGY PROTOCOLS WERE CONDUCTED BY THE TRAVIS COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER’S OFFICE (MEO). ACCORDING TO THE AUTOPSY REPORT, DEATH WAS ATTRIBUTED TO “BLUNT FORCE INJURIES.” NO DRUGS OR ETHANOL WERE DETECTED

THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION’S (FAA) CIVIL AEROSPACE MEDICAL INSTITUTE (CAMI) ALSO CONDUCTED A TOXICOLOGY SCREEN. CARBON MONOXIDE AND CYANIDE TESTS WERE NOT PERFORMED. CAMI’S REPORT CORROBORATED THE FINDINGS CONTAINED IN THE TRAVIS COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER’S REPORT.


TESTS AND RESEARCH

THE INBOARD PORTIONS OF BOTH ROTOR BLADES, THE ROTOR HUB, ROTOR GRIPS, PITCH LINKAGES, SWASH PLATE, AND TRANSMISSION WERE SENT TO NTSB’S METALLURGICAL LABORATORY IN WASHINGTON, DC, FOR EXAMINATION. THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE LATER TESTED FOR BLOOD AND BIRD RESIDUE WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS. THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON THE MATERIALS LABORATORY FACTUAL REPORT:

THE HUB. THE HUB BORE SIMILAR FRACTURES ON BOTH SIDES. THE FRACTURE FACES REVEALED A COARSE GRAINY SURFACE AND SURFACE LINES CONSISTENT WITH OVERLOAD. MECHANICAL DAMAGED WAS CONSISTENT WITH BEING IMPACTED BY THE ARCED UPPER EDGE OF THE TUSK. BOTH LOWER EDGES ADJACENT TO THE FRACTURE FACES WERE CURVED OUTWARD. EXAMINATION OF THE DROOP STOPS REVEALED INDENTATIONS FROM THE EDGES OF THE TUSK AND DISPLACED MATERIAL. THE TEETER STOPS REVEALED A LATERAL FRACTURE AND A ROUNDED INDENTATION BELOW THE FRACTURE. THE TUSK WAS BENT INWARDLY AND THERE WAS A CONTACT MARK MADE WHEN THE SPINDLE CONTACTED THE TEETER STOP. THE FRACTURE FACE, WHICH WAS CONTAINED WITHIN THE HOLE IN THE SPINDLE, DISPLAYED A UNIFORM TEXTURE WITH SURFACE LINES. THERE WAS A CRESCENT SHAPED GAP BETWEEN THE CONING BOLT AND THE HOLE IN THE SPINDLE, CONSISTENT WITH A SHEAR OVERLOAD. THE FRACTURE FACE ON THE SHANK WAS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH SHEAR OVERLOAD. BOTH PITCH ARM 1 AND 2 DISPLAYED FRACTURE FACES THAT DISPLAYED A GRAINY SURFACE, CONSISTENT WITH OVERLOAD.

MAIN ROTOR BLADES, CYCLIC YOKE, BELLCRANK AND SHAFT. THE CYCLIC YOKE AND BELLCRANK ASSEMBLY WAS MECHANICALLY AND FIRE DAMAGED, AND FOUR OF THE FIVE ROD ENDS HAD PORTIONS OF THEIR PUSH-PULL TUBE ASSEMBLIES STILL ATTACHED. THE TWO YOKE BOLTS WERE BENT WITH THE FORWARD BOLT RESTRICTING THE MOVEMENT OF THE ATTACHED BELLCRANK. FIRE DAMAGE AND MECHANICAL DAMAGE HAD OBLITERATED MOST OF THE FINER FRACTURE FEATURES ON THE TUBE PORTIONS REMAINING ON FOUR OF THE FIVE ROD ENDS, BUT THE REMAINING LARGER FEATURES DISPLAYED SHEAR LIPS CONSISTENT WITH OVERLOAD. ONE ROD END DISPLAYED A FRACTURED THREAD WITH A DISTINCT BEND. A PORTION OF THE DRIVE DISPLAYED A CUT END, A FRACTURED END, AND CIRCUMFERENTIAL SCRATCHES THAT, IN SOME AREAS, HAD REMOVED THE PAINT TO EXPOSE THE METAL. THE FRACTURED END WAS COMPRESSED WITH LOCAL INWARD DEFORMATIONS, AND THE FRACTURE FACE DISPLAYED SHEAR LIPS CONSISTENT WITH OVERLOAD. A PORTION OF PUSH-PULL TUBE DISPLAYED A CUT END AND A FRACTURED END. THE FRACTURED END WAS BENT AND DEFORMED TO FORM A ROUGH OVAL, WITH THE FRACTURE FACE DISPLAYING SHEAR LIPS CONSISTENT WITH A BENDING OVERLOAD EVENT.

MAIM MAST ASSEMBLY AND JACKSHAFT. ONE PIECE OF THE MAIN MAST ASSEMBLY CONSISTED OF THE MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX WITH A MAJOR PORTION OF THE MAST TUBE, AND THE OTHER PIECE CONSISTED OF A MINOR PORTION OF THE MAST TUBE WITH THE SWASHPLATE ASSEMBLY. THE FRACTURED END OF A PITCH LINK THAT ORIGINALLY MATED TO THE ROD END WAS STILL ATTACHED TO THE SWASHPLATE. EXAMINATION OF THE FRACTURE FACE REVEALED A GRAINY SURFACE CONSISTENT WITH AN OVERLOAD EVENT. THE COLLECTIVE JACKSHAFT WAS CORRODED AND PORTIONS OF TWO CONTROL RODS DISPLAYED WHITE POWDERY SURFACES, CONSISTENT WITH BEING EXPOSED TO FIRE. THE BOTTOM (OR SUMP) OF THE MAIN GEARBOX WAS CRACKED. THE BOLTS ATTACHING THE FRACTURED PORTIONS OF THE MAIN ROTOR GEARBOX SUMP TO THE CASE APPEARED BENT. EXAMINATION OF THE FRACTURE FACES REVEALED A UNIFORM GRAINY SURFACE, CONSISTENT WITH OVERLOAD. THE LOWER SUPPORT BEARING OUTER RACE BORE DISTINCT CONTACT MARKS FROM THE BEARING’S ROLLERS. EXAMINATION OF THE FRACTURE FACE REVEALED A GRAINY SURFACE CONSISTENT WITH AN OVERLOAD EVENT. THE ARCED OUTER EDGE OF DEFORMED MATERIAL WAS CENTERED ON THE FRACTURED BOLT, CONSISTENT WITH IT BEING PRODUCED BY THE ROD END ORIGINALLY AT THAT LOCATION.

PITCH LINK. THE PITCH LINK BORE MULTIPLE BENDS AND FRACTURED BOLTS IN THE ROD ENDS AT BOTH ENDS. THE PITCH LINK WAS SUITABLY WIRE-LOCKED TO THE FITTING, AND THE THREADED PORTIONS DISPLAYED JAM NUTS AND PALNUTS.

MAIN ROTOR BLADES. ONE MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS BENT DOWNWARD BEND AND THERE WAS SKIN WRINKLING. THE OTHER BLADE DISPLAYED A SMOOTH REARWARD BEND AND SKIN WRINKLING. THE OUTER TIP OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS APPROXIMATELY 11 INCHES LONG, AND THE OUTER 8 INCHES OF THE BLACK COATING ON THE LEADING EDGE WAS ERODED.  THERE WAS MECHANICAL DAMAGE TO THE TIP COVER. THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE TIP COVER HAD BEEN SHEARED INBOARD.

THE METALLURGICAL REPORT NOTED THAT THE MAIN ROTOR HUB ROTATES COUNTERCLOCKWISE ABOUT THE TEETER BOLT WHEN VIEWED FROM ABOVE. THE MAIN ROTOR SPINDLES ROTATE INDEPENDENTLY ABOUT THE CONING BOLTS, AND THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE HUBS ROTATE ABOUT THE SPINDLES CONTROLLED BY THE PITCH CHANGE LINKS.  AS THE MAIN ROTOR SLOWS DOWN DURING ENGINE SHUT-OFF, THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES DROOP UNTIL THE TUSK CONTACTS THE DROOP STOP. THE REPORT CONCLUDED THAT THE ROBINSON R22 HELICOPTER, LIKE OTHER HELICOPTERS WITH A SEMI-RIGID ROTOR SYSTEM, IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO MAST BUMPING.

ACCORDING TO ROBINSON HELICOPTERS, “MAST BUMPING” REFERS TO TEETERING BEYOND THE ALLOWABLE TEETER CLEARANCE IN THE HUB, RESULTING IN CONTACT (INDIRECT IN THIS CASE) BETWEEN THE HUB AND THE MAIN ROTOR SHAFT. “LOW-G MAST BUMPING” IS THE PHENOMENON SPECIFIC TO 2 BLADED TEETERING ROTOR SYSTEMS IN WHICH THE ROTOR DISC BECOMES UNLOADED, NORMALLY DUE TO A CYCLIC PUSHOVER OR SOMETHING SIMILAR, AND IT FREQUENTLY LEADS TO SEPARATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR SHAFT. “MAST BUMPING” CAN OCCUR DURING MANY SITUATIONS. “LOW ROTOR RPM ROTOR STALL” IS A DIFFERENT PHENOMENON, BUT “MAST BUMPING” FREQUENTLY OCCURS WITHIN THE ROTOR HEAD AS PART OF THE SEQUENCE. IN THIS ACCIDENT, THERE ARE DAMAGE SIGNATURES IN THE CONTROLS, MAIN ROTOR HEAD AND MAIN ROTOR BLADES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH BOTH “LOW-G MAST BUMPING” AND “LOW ROTOR RPM ROTOR STALL.”


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

RADAR DATA IN THE FORM OF NOP (NATIONAL OFFLOAD PROGRAM) WAS OBTAINED FROM KAUS’S APPROACH CONTROL. THE DATA DEPICTED N7779M DEPARTING TAYLOR, TEXAS, ABOUT 1705:03 UTC (1205 CDT), AND PROCEEDING TOWARDS LULING. ALTITUDE VARIED FROM 1,200 TO 1,400 FEET MSL (ABOVE MEAN SEA LEVEL) FOR MOST OF THE FLIGHT.

SHORTLY AFTER THE ACCIDENT HAD OCCURRED, THE HELICOPTER OPERATOR FLEW THE SAME COURSE FLOWN BY THE PILOT OF N7779M, AND REQUESTED THAT KAUS APPROACH CONTROL TRACK HIM ON RADAR. HE WANTED TO SEE HOW LOW RADAR WOULD DETECT HIM. RADAR TRACKED HIM TO THE TOP OF THE TREE AT THE IMPACT SITE.  THE OPERATOR CALCULATED THAT IT WOULD TAKE LESS THAN THE FIVE SECONDS TO DESCEND FROM 1100 FEET MSL (THE LAST KNOWN ALTITUDE OF THE HELICOPTER) TO GROUND IMPACT (LESS THAN 400 FEET MSL). AFTER HE CALCULATED GROUND SPEED AND ALTITUDE, HE COMPUTED THE RATE OF DECENT TO BE OVER 7,000 FEET PER MINUTE. THE OPERATOR STATED AUTOROTATIONS DO NOT PRODUCE MORE THAN A 2,000 FEET PER MINUTE RATE OF DECENT.","THE HELICOPTER WAS FLYING ACROSS A RIVER WHEN WITNESSES HEARD A LOUD ""POP"" OR ""BANG"" AND SAW SOMETHING FALL FROM THE HELICOPTER INTO THE RIVER. THEY HEARD THE HELICOPTER CRASH, SAW SMOKE, AND RAN TO THE CRASH SITE. ONE MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS FOUND APPROXIMATELY 780 FEET FROM THE WRECKAGE. THE OTHER MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS FOUND APPROXIMATELY 975 FEET FROM THE WRECKAGE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BOTH BLADES HAD SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN ROTOR HUB AT THEIR CONING HINGES. ALL COMPONENTS OF THE HELICOPTER WERE ACCOUNTED FOR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PORTIONS OF BOTH CONING BOLTS. THE INVESTIGATION WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE THE OBJECT OBSERVED FALLING FROM THE HELICOPTER OR DETERMINE WHAT IT WAS. EXAMINATION OF THE ROTOR HEAD COMPONENTS, INCLUDING THE RECOVERED PORTIONS OF THE CONING BOLTS, REVEALED FRACTURE FEATURES CONSISTENT WITH OVERLOAD FAILURE AND MECHANICAL DAMAGE INDICATIVE OF MAST BUMPING (CONTACT BETWEEN THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES AND THE MAST). THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE PITCH LINKS AND ATTACHING HARDWARE DISPLAYED COMPRESSION BUCKLING AND BENDING OVERLOAD FEATURES CONSISTENT WITH AN OUT-OF-CONTROL MAIN ROTOR THAT HAD DIVERGED FROM ITS NORMAL PLANE OF ROTATION. THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER REPORTED THAT THE DAMAGE SIGNATURES WERE CONSISTENT WITH BOTH LOW-G MAST BUMPING AND LOW ROTOR RPM ROTOR STALL. LOW-G MAST BUMPING IS A PHENOMENON SPECIFIC TO TWO-BLADED TEETERING ROTOR SYSTEMS IN WHICH THE ROTOR DISC BECOMES UNLOADED, TYPICALLY DUE TO A CYCLIC PUSHOVER. LOW ROTOR RPM ROTOR STALL IS A DIFFERENT PHENOMENON IN WHICH THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES EXPERIENCE AN AERODYNAMIC STALL DUE TO LOW ROTOR RPM CAUSED EITHER BY THE PILOT RAISING THE COLLECTIVE TOO MUCH OR BY A LOSS OF ENGINE POWER FOLLOWED BY THE PILOT LOWERING THE COLLECTIVE TOO SLOWLY. ROTOR BLADE STALL CAN LEAD TO MAST BUMPING. THE PILOT’S CONTROL INPUTS LEADING UP TO THE EVENT ARE UNKNOWN, AND, THEREFORE, THE REASON FOR THE MAIN ROTOR DIVERGENCE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED.","THE DIVERGENCE OF THE MAIN ROTOR FROM ITS NORMAL PLANE OF ROTATION FOR REASONS THAT CANNOT BE DETERMINED BECAUSE THE PILOT’S CONTROL INPUTS LEADING UP TO THE EVENT ARE UNKNOWN, RESULTING IN MAST BUMPING AND MAIN ROTOR BLADE SEPARATION."

ON OCTOBER 1, 2011, ABOUT 1255 MOUNTAIN DAYLIGHT TIME, A ROBINSON HELICOPTER, R66, N266CY, WAS DESTROYED DURING AN IN-FLIGHT BREAKUP WHILE IN CRUISE FLIGHT NEAR PHILIP, SOUTH DAKOTA. THE PRIVATE PILOT, THE SOLE OCCUPANT, WAS FATALLY INJURED. THE HELICOPTER WAS REGISTERED TO AND OPERATED BY P.P. AND J. LLC., OF GILLETTE, WYOMING. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AND A FLIGHT PLAN WAS NOT FILED FOR THE 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS PART 91 PERSONAL FLIGHT. THE CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT ORIGINATED FROM THE GILLETTE-CAMPBELL COUNTY AIRPORT (GCC), AROUND 1105 AND WAS EN ROUTE TO THE WINNER REGIONAL AIRPORT (ICR), IN WINNER, SOUTH DAKOTA.

A FRIEND OF THE PILOT WAS AT GCC WHEN THE PILOT WAS PREPARING FOR THE FLIGHT. THE FRIEND REPORTED THAT THE PILOT APPEARED TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH AND WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE FLIGHT. HE FURTHER REPORTED THAT THE PILOT HAD ""TOPPED OFF"" THE HELICOPTER WITH FUEL BEFORE DEPARTURE. APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER THE PILOT CALLED THE FRIEND DURING THE FLIGHT. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE WAS BETWEEN WALL, SOUTH DAKOTA, AND PHILIP, SOUTH DAKOTA, AND INQUIRED IF THE PHILIP AIRPORT (PHP), HAD JET FUEL AVAILABLE. THE FRIEND CALLED THE PILOT BACK A FEW MINUTES LATER TO REPORT THAT PHP DID NOT HAVE JET FUEL. THE FRIEND STATED THAT THE PILOT DID NOT REPORT ANY ANOMALIES WITH THE HELICOPTER DURING EITHER CONVERSATION. 

AN EYEWITNESS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES NORTHWEST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER FLYING FROM WEST TO EAST, ALONG A RIVER, APPROXIMATELY 1,000 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL (AGL). THE EYEWITNESS REPORTED THAT HE HEARD NOTHING ABNORMAL AS THE HELICOPTER FLEW PAST HIM. HE THEN OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER MAKE A TURN TO THE LEFT BEFORE IT FLEW OUT OF VIEW BEHIND TREES. ABOUT 20-30 SECONDS LATER, HE HEARD A NOISE THAT HE DESCRIBED AS SOUNDING LIKE AN ""EXPLODING PROPANE TANK.""

PERSONNEL INFORMATION

THE PILOT, AGED 64, HELD A PRIVATE PILOT CERTIFICATE WITH AIRPLANE SINGLE AND MULTI-ENGINE LAND, ROTORCRAFT HELICOPTER, AND INSTRUMENT AIRPLANE. HE WAS ISSUED A THIRD-CLASS MEDICAL ON NOVEMBER 3, 2009, WITH THE LIMITATION OF ""MUST HAVE AVAILABLE GLASSES FOR NEAR VISION."" 

THE PILOT'S FLIGHT LOGBOOKS WERE NOT RECOVERED DURING THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION. ON AN AIRCRAFT INSURANCE APPLICATION DATED FEBRUARY 4, 2011, THE PILOT ESTIMATED HAVING LOGGED 3,600 HOURS OF TOTAL FLIGHT TIME WITH 60 HOURS IN THE LAST 90 DAYS. OF THAT TIME, 210 HOURS HAD BEEN IN HELICOPTERS AND 22 HOURS HAD BEEN IN THE ROBINSON R66. THE PILOT ALSO INDICATED THAT HIS LAST BIANNUAL FLIGHT REVIEW HAD TAKEN PLACE ON MAY 5, 2010.

THE NTSB INVESTIGATOR-IN-CHARGE (IIC), CONTACTED THE TWO FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS WHO INSTRUCTED THE ACCIDENT PILOT. THE FIRST INSTRUCTOR REPORTED THAT HE HAD PROVIDED INSTRUCTION TO THE ACCIDENT PILOT ONCE OR TWICE FOR AN ESTIMATED TOTAL OF 2 HOURS IN THE R66. THE SECOND INSTRUCTOR REPORTED THAT HE HAD INSTRUCTED THE ACCIDENT PILOT FOR 1 FLIGHT IN THE R66. BOTH INSTRUCTORS STATED THAT THEY DID NOT PROVIDE A SIGNOFF FOR THE ACCIDENT PILOT IN THE R66; HOWEVER, A SIGNOFF WAS NOT REQUIRED. ALTHOUGH THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) HAD ISSUED SFAR 73-2, SPECIAL TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ROBINSON R-22 AND THE R-44, THE R66 WAS EXCLUDED. 

HELICOPTER INFORMATION

THE 2011-MODEL ROBINSON HELICOPTER CO R66, SERIAL NUMBER 0010, WAS REGISTERED WITH THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION STANDARD AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATE FOR NORMAL OPERATIONS. THE HELICOPTER WAS POWERED BY A TURBO-SHAFT ROLLS-ROYCE RR300 ENGINE, SERIAL NUMBER (SN) RRE200013, WHICH DROVE THE TWO-BLADE MAIN ROTOR.

ACCORDING TO THE AIRFRAME AND ENGINE LOGBOOKS, THE HELICOPTER'S MOST RECENT 100-HOUR INSPECTION WAS COMPLETED ON JUNE 6, 2011, WITH AN AIRFRAME AND ENGINE TOTAL TIME OF 82.6 HOURS.

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

AT 1255, THE AUTOMATED WEATHER OBSERVING SYSTEM AT PHP, LOCATED 3 NAUTICAL MILES NORTHEAST FROM THE SITE OF THE ACCIDENT, REPORTED WIND FROM 150 DEGREES AT 6 KNOTS, 10 MILES VISIBILITY, CLEAR OF CLOUDS, TEMPERATURE 84 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, DEW POINT 39 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, AND A BAROMETRIC PRESSURE SETTING OF 30.00 INCHES OF MERCURY.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER WRECKAGE AND DEBRIS CAME TO REST ON ROLLING RANCH LAND AND WAS SPREAD OUT OVER AN AREA APPROXIMATELY 1,520 FEET LONG BY 600 FEET WIDE. THE MAIN ROTOR HEAD, WITH ATTACHED BLADES, CAME TO REST 513 FEET FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE. THE MAIN WRECKAGE CONSISTED OF THE FUSELAGE, ENGINE, AND TAIL ROTOR ASSEMBLY. 

THE AIRFRAME WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED BY FIRE AND IMPACT FORCES. A FEW PIECES OF AIRFRAME AND NUMEROUS PIECES OF PLEXIGLAS WERE LOCATED AWAY FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE AND WERE NOT FIRE DAMAGED. TWO PORTIONS OF THE RIGHT FORWARD DOOR FRAME EXHIBITED SCORING AND DEFORMATION SIMILAR TO THE SHAPE OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE LEADING EDGE. THE RIGHT FRONT SEAT BOTTOM HAD A LATERAL CUT/IMPACT MARK NEAR THE FORWARD EDGE AND WAS DETACHED FROM THE HELICOPTER. THE CONTROLS AND TUNNEL STRUCTURE EXHIBITED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A CUT/GASH IN A VERTICAL LINE, FROM THE RIGHT SIDE, APPROXIMATELY 5 INCHES FORWARD OF THE COLLECTIVE PIVOT. A SECTION OF THE DOOR FRAME FROM THE LEFT DOOR EXHIBITED LARGE CURVED DENTS, ONE WITH PAINT SMEARING, ON THE INSIDE SURFACES. 

THE CABIN AREA WAS NEARLY CONSUMED BY A POST-CRASH FIRE. ALL REMOVABLE CONTROLS WERE FOUND INSTALLED. THE ENGINE FUEL CONTROL WAS FOUND IN THE FULL ""ON"" POSITION. THE COLLECTIVE WAS IN A FULL UP POSITION, BASED ON THE FRICTION SLIDER. THE AIRFRAME FUEL CUTOFF VALVE WAS EXTENDED ¼ INCH FROM ITS FULL DOWN POSITION.

ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2012, AT 1200 EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME, AN AEROSPATIALE AS 355F1, N58020, OPERATED BY ANALAR CORPORATION, WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED WHEN IT IMPACTED TERRAIN FOLLOWING AN IN-FLIGHT BREAKUP NEAR WEST WINDSOR, NEW JERSEY. THE COMMERCIAL PILOT WAS FATALLY INJURED. THE POSITIONING FLIGHT WAS CONDUCTED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS PART 91. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE PLANNED FLIGHT TO ATLANTIC CITY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (ACY), ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY. THE FLIGHT ORIGINATED FROM PRINCETON AIRPORT (39N), PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY, ABOUT 1155.

ACCORDING TO THE OWNER AND PRESIDENT OF THE OPERATOR, THE HELICOPTER HAD FLOWN DURING THE SUMMER WITH A LOANER MAIN TRANSMISSION, WHILE ITS OWN TRANSMISSION WAS SENT OUT FOR REPAIR. AFTER THE REPAIR WAS COMPLETE, THE HELICOPTER'S MAIN TRANSMISSION WAS RECEIVED AND THEN REINSTALLED ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2012. AFTER THE INSTALLATION, THE PRESIDENT CONDUCTED A MAINTENANCE GROUND RUN, FOLLOWED BY A 30-MINUTE MAINTENANCE TEST FLIGHT, WITH NO ANOMALIES NOTED. EARLIER DURING THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, THE ACCIDENT PILOT COMPLETED A ROUNDTRIP FLIGHT UNEVENTFULLY, WITH A RELATIVE OF THE HELICOPTER OWNER ONBOARD. SPECIFICALLY, THE PILOT FLEW FROM 39N TO THE WEST 30TH STREET HELIPORT (JRA), NEW YORK, NEW YORK, PICKED UP THE PASSENGER, AND FLEW BACK TO 39N. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THAT FLIGHT, THE HELICOPTER WAS ""HOT FUELED"" TO ITS MAXIMUM FUEL CAPACITY AND THEN DEPARTED ON THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT TO PICK UP ANOTHER RELATIVE OF THE HELICOPTER OWNER AT ACY. THE PRESIDENT ESTIMATED THAT THE HELICOPTER HAD FLOWN APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR 10 MINUTES SINCE THE INSTALLATION OF THE TRANSMISSION WHEN THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED. 

ACCORDING TO INFORMATION FROM THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA), THE HELICOPTER WAS IN RADIO AND RADAR CONTACT WITH MCGUIRE APPROACH CONTROL. RADIO AND RADAR CONTACT WERE LOST AT 1200 AND NO DISTRESS CALLS WERE RECEIVED. WITNESSES NEAR THE AREA OF THE ACCIDENT SITE REPORTED HEARING A BANGING, EXPLOSION, OR ENGINE REV NOISE, FOLLOWED BY A PIECE SEPARATING FROM THE HELICOPTER AND THE HELICOPTER SPIRALING NOSE DOWN TOWARD THE GROUND.

THE VENTRAL FIN REMAINED ATTACHED; HOWEVER, THE LOWER END OF THE FIN SUSTAINED IMPACT DAMAGE. THE TAILBOOM HAD SEPARATED FORWARD OF THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER. THE TAILROTOR DRIVESHAFT REMAINED INTACT FROM THE TAILROTOR GEARBOX TO JUST PRIOR TO THE FORWARD SPLINE, WHERE THE TAILROTOR DRIVESHAFT HAD MELTED. ONE TAILROTOR BLADE REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE TAILROTOR HUB. THE OTHER TAILROTOR BLADE SEPARATED AT THE HUB AND WAS FOUND 25 YARDS NORTH, CONSISTENT WITH IMPACT DAMAGE. THE LEFT ENGINE COWLING, WITH ITS INTAKE SCREEN, WAS LOCATED ABOUT 140 YARDS SOUTH OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE. THE COWLING WAS COATED WITH CLEAN (LIGHT YELLOW/BROWN) OIL ON BOTH SIDES.

THE ROTORHEAD, LOCATED ABOUT 100 YARDS SOUTHWEST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE, INCLUDED THE TOP PORTION OF TRANSMISSION (THE CONICAL HOUSING WITH THE EPICYCLIC AND RING GEAR ATTACHED), THE MAIN ROTOR SHAFT, THE STARFLEX, AND THE RED AND BLUE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WITH THEIR SLEEVES AND SPHERICAL THRUST BEARINGS ATTACHED. ALSO INCLUDED WERE TWO SERVOS (LEFT-ROLL AND RIGHT-ROLL) AND THREE PITCH CHANGE RODS. A THIRD SERVO (FORE/AFT) WAS FOUND NEAR THE ROTORHEAD, BUT HAD SEPARATED AT BOTH ROD END CONNECTIONS; BOTH UPPER AND LOWER ROD END BEARINGS REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE STATIONARY SWASHPLATE AND CONICAL HOUSING, RESPECTIVELY. THE ENTIRE YELLOW MAIN ROTOR BLADE AND SLEEVE ASSEMBLY HAD SEPARATED FROM THE ROTORHEAD AND WAS LATER RECOVERED ABOUT 270 YARDS SOUTHEAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE. THE YELLOW STAR ARM HAD SEPARATED FROM THE STARFLEX AND WAS LOCATED ABOUT 40 YARDS SOUTH OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE. THE LOWER (STATIONARY) SCISSOR LINK ASSEMBLY SEPARATED FROM BOTH HINGES AND WAS NOT RECOVERED. THE ROTORHEAD HAD SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN TRANSMISSION NEAR THE UPPER FLANGE OF THE BEVEL GEAR REDUCTION MODULE'S CYLINDRICAL HOUSING; THE FRACTURE SURFACE REMAINED INTACT WITH THE SEPARATED ROTORHEAD (FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE AIRWORTHINESS GROUP CHAIRMAN FACTUAL REPORT IN THE PUBLIC DOCKET). 

METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE RETAINED COMPONENTS REVEALED THAT THE UPPER ROD END OF THE FORE/AFT SERVO (ACTUATOR) REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE SWASHPLATE AND EXHIBITED A BENDING OVERSTRESS FRACTURE NEAR ITS NECK. THE LOWER THREADED END OF THE UPPER ROD END (SHANK, NUT, AND LOCK WASHER) WAS NOT IN THE ACTUATOR AND WAS NOT RECOVERED. THE MATING THREADS OF THE FORE/AFT SERVO UPPER END FITTING EXHIBITED SEVERE WEAR, CONSISTENT WITH THREAD WEAR OCCURRING OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. THE UPPER END FITTING WAS PACKED WITH SOIL, CONSISTENT WITH ITS EXPOSURE PRIOR TO GROUND IMPACT. ADDITIONALLY, NEW THREAD IMPRESSIONS WERE OBSERVED, BELOW THE ORIGINAL WORN THREADS, CONSISTENT WITH A VIBRATION OF THE SHANK IN THE ACTUATOR HOLE. METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION OF ALL OTHER RETAINED COMPONENTS DID NOT REVEAL ANY PREIMPACT MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS (FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE MATERIALS LABORATORY FACTUAL REPORT IN THE PUBLIC DOCKET.)

EVIDENCE OF MASTINOX, A CORROSION INHIBITING COMPOUND, WAS FOUND ON THE THREADED SHANK OF THE LEFT-ROLL AND RIGHT-ROLL SERVO’S UPPER ROD END (THREADED SHANK OF FORE/AFT SERVO UPPER ROD END NOT RECOVERED). EVIDENCE OF MASTINOX WAS NOT FOUND ON THE REMNANT UPPER ROD END AND END FITTING OF THE FORE/AFT SERVO; HOWEVER, THE OPERATOR REPORTED THAT THEY USED MASTINOX FOR THE SERVO CONNECTIONS DUE TO THE DISSIMILAR METALS (ALUMINUM AND STEEL) AND COVERED THE MASTINOX WITH A ""THIN"" LAYER OF GREASE. NO EVIDENCE OF GREASE WAS OBSERVED ON THE SERVO ROD ENDS OR FITTINGS. FOR THE SERVO ROD ENDS’ THREADED CONNECTION, THE EUROCOPTER MAINTENANCE MANUAL (MM) LISTED ONLY G.355 GREASE AND DID NOT PRESCRIBE FOR THE USE OF MASTINOX. HOWEVER, THE EUROCOPTER STANDARD PRACTICES MANUAL STATED THAT A TORQUE CORRECTION FACTOR OF 0.4 WAS USED FOR G.355 GREASE, BUT NOT FOR MASTINOX. ACCORDING TO A REPRESENTATIVE FROM EUROCOPTER, THE TORQUE VALUE LISTED IN THE MANUAL FOR THE ROD ENDS ALREADY TOOK THE TORQUE CORRECTION FACTOR INTO ACCOUNT AND A HIGHER TORQUE WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY WHEN MASTINOX WAS USED IN PLACE OF G.355 GREASE. THE OPERATOR REPORTED THAT THEY DID NOT ADJUST TORQUE FACTOR WHEN USING THE MASTINOX WITH A ""THIN"" LAYER OF GREASE. ADDITIONALLY, EVIDENCE OF SEALANT AT THE JUNCTION OF THE UPPER ROD END AND NUT WAS NOT FOUND ON EITHER THE LEFT-ROLL OR RIGHT-ROLL SERVOS (THE SEALANT AREA ON FORE/AFT SERVO WAS NOT RECOVERED FOR INSPECTION). MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES FOR THE INSTALLATION OF THE ROD ENDS OF THE SERVO-CONTROLS WERE FOUND IN THE EUROCOPTER MAINTENANCE MANUAL (MET) WORK CARD (WC) 67.30.15.401. REVIEW OF THE WC REVEALED ""…APPLY A BEAD OF SEALANT ON THE NUT (8) AND THE THREAD OF THE BALL END (1)…""

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

AN AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED ON THE PILOT BY THE MERCER COUNTY, OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER, WEST TRENTON, NEW JERSEY, ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2012. THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS NOTED AS ""MASSIVE MULTIPLE TRAUMATIC INJURIES."" TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING WAS PERFORMED ON THE PILOT BY THE FAA BIOAERONAUTICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH LABORATORY, OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA. REVIEW OF THE TOXICOLOGICAL REPORT REVEALED:

""METOPROLOL DETECTED IN BLOOD"" 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

FORE/AFT SERVO

THE AIR EQUIPMENT F6103 31026-010 (SERIAL NUMBER 68) FORE/AFT SERVO WAS MANUFACTURED IN 1981 AND INSTALLED ON THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER IN 1994. IT'S MOST RECENT OVERHAUL WAS COMPLETED BY AEROCOPTER COMPONENT SERVICES (ACS), ONTARIO, CANADA, IN MARCH 2008. IN AUGUST 2010, THE FORE/AFT SERVO WAS REPAIRED BY ACS AND RECERTIFIED TO MANUFACTURER SPECIFICATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH AIR EQUIPMENT COMPONENT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (CMM) NO. 67-39-10. SPECIFICALLY, A BEARING WAS REPLACED DUE TO PLAY IN THE PILOT VALVE. IN NOVEMBER 2011, THE FORE/AFT SERVO WAS AGAIN REPAIRED BY ACS AND RECERTIFIED TO MANUFACTURER SPECIFICATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SAME CMM. DURING THE SECOND REPAIR, ITEMS WERE REPLACED DUE TO HYDRAULIC FLUID SEEPAGE. A MANAGER AT ACS STATED THAT DURING THE MOST RECENT REPAIR, THE THREADS WERE INSPECTED PER THE CMM AND NO DISCREPANCIES WERE OBSERVED AT THAT TIME. REVIEW OF THE CMM REVEALED, ""…CHECK ALL MALE AND FEMALE THREADS FOR GENERAL CONDITION…"" 

REVIEW OF MET WC 05.21.00.603, TITLED ""DAILY OPERATING CHECKS"" (AFTER LAST FLIGHT OF DAY) REVEALED, ""SERVOCONTROLS, HYDRAULIC SYSTEM. SECURITY, ABSENCE OF LEAKS, LINES."" 

REVIEW OF MET WC 05.23.00, TITLED ""BASIC INSPECTION"" (T INSPECTION/600-HOUR INSPECTION), SECTION 6.3, REVEALED:

""SERVO-CONTROLS AND PARTICULARLY ROD END BEARINGS
(FIG. 1, DETAIL B) :
DISCONNECT A MOUNTING PIN (W.C. 67.30.00.402 OR 67.30.15.402).
MANUALLY CHECK THAT RADIAL PLAY (J) IS NORMAL, THE SECOND ANCHORING POINT BEING USED AS FULCRUM. J 
IF IN DOUBT, REMOVE SERVO-CONTROL AS PER W.C. 67.30.00.402 OR 67.30.15.402 FOR CHECK IN WORKSHOP.
CONNECT OR INSTALL SERVO-CONTROL AS PER W.C. 67.30.00.402 OR 67.30.15.402.""

WHILE THE BASIC T/600-HOUR INSPECTION CALLED FOR CHECKING RADIAL PLAY OF THE ROD END BEARINGS, THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC GUIDANCE TO CHECK EITHER THE SECURITY (TORQUE) OF THE ROD END NUT TO THE SERVO END FITTING OR TO INSPECT THE CONDITION OF THE THREADED CONNECTION. REVIEW OF EUROCOPTER STANDARD PRACTICES MANUAL W.C. 20.02.05.404 CONTAINED GENERAL GUIDANCE FOR THE INSPECTION OF THREADED COMPONENTS, WHICH MUST BE PERFORMED EACH TIME AN EXTERNALLY THREADED PART IS REMOVED. OTHER THAN THE NOTE IN THE DAILY OPERATING CHECK TO LOOK FOR SECURITY AND ABSENCE OF LEAKS, THERE WAS NO OTHER GUIDANCE SPECIFICALLY PERTAINING TO THE SECURITY OF THE ROD END CONNECTION TO THE SERVO END FITTING.","DURING CRUISE FLIGHT, WITNESSES ON THE GROUND REPORTED HEARING A GRINDING OR POPPING NOISE, WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY THE SEPARATION OF THE YELLOW MAIN ROTOR BLADE. EXAMINATION OF THE FORE/AFT SERVO REVEALED THAT THE INTERNAL THREADS OF THE UPPER ROD END FITTING ON THE SERVO WERE SEVERELY WORN. THE LOWER THREADED PORTION OF THE UPPER ROD END WAS NOT FOUND SECURED INTO THE SERVO'S UPPER END FITTING AND WAS NOT RECOVERED. ADDITIONALLY, THE UPPER END FITTING WAS PACKED WITH SOIL AS THE LOWER THREADED PORTION OF THE UPPER ROD END HAD SEPARATED FROM IT PRIOR TO GROUND IMPACT. A 100-HOUR MAINTENANCE INSPECTION OF THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER HAD BEEN COMPLETED ON THE MORNING OF THE ACCIDENT AND A 600-HOUR INSPECTION OF THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WAS COMPLETED ABOUT 3 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. NEITHER INSPECTION DETECTED THE WORN THREADS ON THE FORE/AFT SERVO UPPER END FITTING. THE FORE/AFT SERVO HAD BEEN OVERHAULED ABOUT 4 YEARS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE FORE/AFT SERVO WAS REPAIRED 10 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT AND NO ANOMALIES WERE OBSERVED WITH THE THREADS AT THAT TIME. 

THE OPERATOR USED MASTINOX, A CORROSION INHIBITING COMPOUND, DURING INSTALLATION OF THE UPPER ROD ENDS TO THE RIGHT-ROLL, LEFT-ROLL, AND FORE/AFT SERVOS. THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER'S MAINTENANCE MANUAL LISTED ONLY G.355 GREASE AND DID NOT PRESCRIBE FOR THE USE OF MASTINOX. HOWEVER, THE STANDARD PRACTICES MANUAL STATED THAT A TORQUE CORRECTION FACTOR OF 0.4 IS USED FOR G.355 GREASE, BUT NOT FOR MASTINOX, SINCE THE LATTER IS NOT A LUBRICANT. THE TORQUE VALUE LISTED IN THE MANUAL FOR THE ROD ENDS ALREADY TOOK A TORQUE CORRECTION FACTOR INTO ACCOUNT. A HIGHER TORQUE VALUE WOULD THEORETICALLY HAVE BEEN NECESSARY WHEN MASTINOX WAS USED IN PLACE OF G.355 GREASE. THE OPERATOR STATED AN ADJUSTED TORQUE VALUE WAS NOT USED DURING INSTALLATION OF THE UPPER ROD ENDS USING MASTINOX. EVIDENCE OF SEALANT AT THE JUNCTION OF THE UPPER ROD END AND NUT, WHICH WAS REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED DURING SERVO INSTALLATION PER THE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES, WAS NOT FOUND ON EITHER THE RIGHT-ROLL OR LEFT-ROLL SERVOS. WHILE THE LACK OF SEALANT MAY NOT RESULT IN A CATASTROPHIC EVENT, ITS BREAKAGE OR ABSENCE (AND/OR RADIAL PLAY OF A SERVO END BEARING) NOTED DURING A MAINTENANCE INSPECTION COULD BE INDICATIVE OF A LOSS OF TORQUE. 

REVIEW OF THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER'S CHECKLISTS AND MAINTENANCE MANUALS REVEALED SOME GUIDANCE FOR SERVO INSPECTIONS. THE DAILY OPERATING CHECK (AFTER THE LAST FLIGHT OF THE DAY) INCLUDED AN INSTRUCTION TO CHECK THE MAIN ROTOR SERVOS FOR SECURITY AND ABSENCE OF LEAKS. THE 600-HOUR INSPECTION CALLED FOR CHECKING THE RADIAL PLAY OF THE END BEARINGS; HOWEVER, THERE WERE NO INSTRUCTIONS TO SPECIFICALLY CHECK THE THREADS OF THE SERVO END FITTING OR THE TORQUE OF THE ROD END NUT.","DISCONNECTION OF THE UPPER ROD END FROM THE FORE/AFT SERVO DUE TO SEVERELY WORN THREADS, WHICH RESULTED IN A LOSS OF CONTROL AND SEPARATION OF A MAIN ROTOR BLADE DURING CRUISE FLIGHT. CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WERE INCORRECT MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES AND INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS PERFORMED BY THE OPERATOR, AND INSUFFICIENT INSPECTION CRITERIA PROVIDED BY THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER."

VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED FOR THE FLIGHT THAT ORIGINATED NEAR THE ACCIDENT SITE, WHICH WAS ABOUT TWO MILES NORTHEAST OF CHILDRESS, TEXAS.

THE LONG-LINE OPERATION CONSISTED OF A 50 FOOT LONG-LINE WITH A WEB SEAT ATTACHED TO AND SUSPENDED UNDERNEATH THE HELICOPTER. THE LONG-LINE WORKER WAS PERFORMING WORK ON THE POWER LINE WHILE ATTACHED TO THE HELICOPTER HOVERING OVERHEAD.

THE PILOT SAID THAT THEY HAD PLANNED TO HANG TRAVELERS ON A SECTION OF EAST/WEST POWER LINE TOWERS ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT. HE SAID THAT ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, A 15-GALLON FUEL LOAD WAS ""WORKING BEST."" HIS RULE FOR REFUELING WAS THAT HE OBTAINED FUEL WHEN THE FUEL GAUGE INDICATION WAS CLOSE TO 100 POUNDS, WHICH HE SAID WOULD ALMOST ALLOW A ½-HOUR OF FLIGHT TIME. 

A COMPANY MECHANIC SAID THAT THE FIRST OPERATION OF THE DAY WAS TO UNCLIP THE LINES. A FULL LOAD OF FUEL WAS LOADED ONTO THE HELICOPTER WITH ONLY THE MAIN TANK FUELED. HE SAID THAT HE REMEMBERED FILLING THE HELICOPTER WITH FUEL TWO TIMES AND EACH TIME 15 GALLONS OF FUEL WAS LOADED, WHICH WAS THE AMOUNT SPECIFIED BY THE PILOT. THE MECHANIC DID NOT KNOW HOW MUCH FUEL WAS ADDED PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. THE MECHANIC SAID THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS GONE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR SINCE ITS LAST REFUELING PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. THE FUEL ADDED WAS NOT RECORDED IN A LOG. 

ABOUT 1400, THE PILOT DEPARTED ON A FLIGHT TO REPAIR A SECTION OF FIBER OPTIC LINE THAT FELL DOWN BEFORE WORK CONTINUED ON THE TOWERS. HE THEN FLEW BACK AND LANDED AT THE LANDING ZONE WHERE THE HELICOPTER WAS RE-RIGGED FOR CREW OPERATIONS AND REFUELED. HE LIFTED OFF WITH THE LONG-LINE WORKER, AND THEY WORKED ON SEVERAL TOWERS. A TRAVELER WAS HUNG ON THE TOWER NEAR THE ACCIDENT SITE, AND THE HELICOPTER WAS POSITIONED IN A STABLE HOVER ABOUT 120-150 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. THE HELICOPTER EXPERIENCED A PRONOUNCED SHARP LEFT YAW, WHICH THE PILOT THOUGHT WAS FROM A WIND GUST. THE PILOT SAID THAT IT WAS ""MILLISECONDS"" BETWEEN THE LEFT YAW AND THE ENGINE ""WINDING DOWN."" THE PILOT DID NOT HEAR ANY UNUSUAL NOISES OR VIBRATIONS BEFORE THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER AND THE ONLY ANNUNCIATION HE HAD TIME TO SEE WAS THE ENGINE-OUT ANNUNCIATION. HE DID NOT SEE ANY OTHER RED/YELLOW ANNUNCIATORS ILLUMINATE. THE PILOT APPLIED RIGHT PEDAL INPUT. THE HELICOPTER STARTED TO SETTLE, AND HE THEN HEARD THE ENGINE OUT HORN AND SAW THE ENGINE OUT LIGHT ILLUMINATE. THE PILOT'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO GET AWAY FROM THE TOWER BECAUSE THE HELICOPTER WOULD HAVE HIT THE LOWER ARM OF THE TOWER. AS THE HELICOPTER MOVED AWAY FROM THE TOWER, HE LOOKED AT THE HORIZON AND ESTIMATED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS ABOUT 50 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND WHEN HE ""BOTTOMED OUT THE COLLECTIVE."" THE HELICOPTER SETTLED FASTER AND ONTO THE GROUND IN A RIGHT-SIDE-LOW ATTITUDE. 

A LONG-LINE WORKER ON THE GROUND SAID THAT HE WAS ABOUT 200-300 FEET AWAY FROM THE HELICOPTER WHEN HE ""HEARD ALL THE SOUND GO AWAY"" AND ""IT JUST SHUT DOWN,"" WHILE THE HELICOPTER WAS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE TOWER. THE HELICOPTER THEN SPUN CLOCKWISE 180 DEGREES WHEN IT LOST POWER. HE SAID THE HELICOPTER ""SEEMED"" TO SPIN AND TURN ""PRETTY FAST"" AND DID NOT RECALL HOW FAST IT SPUN. HE SAID THAT THE LONG-LINE WORKER WAS HANGING ON THE TRAVELER WHEN HE WAS PULLED OFF THE TRAVELER BY THE LONG-LINE. 

THE LONG-LINE WORKER THAT WAS ON THE GROUND AND WITNESSED THE ACCIDENT STATED THERE WAS NO EASY WAY FOR A LONG-LINE WORKER TO RELEASE FROM A HARNESS AND IT WOULD TAKE SEVERAL SECONDS TO DO SO. THE PILOT STATED THERE WAS NO COMPANY POLICY OR PROCEDURE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE LONG-LINE. THE PILOT SAID THAT HE COULD NOT ""SPECIFICALLY SAY"" THAT HE WAS TRAINED TO RELEASE THE LONG-LINE. IF A LONG-LINE WORKER WANTED TO GET OFF OF THE LONG-LINE, HE HAD TO BE ""JETTISONED."" THE PILOT SAID THAT FOR THE LONG-LINE WORKER TO JETTISON THEMSELVES, THEY WOULD HAVE TO USE A KNIFE TO CUT THE LONG-LINE.

HE PERFORMS MAINTENANCE, FUELING, GROUND OPERATIONS, AND THE RIGGING OF EQUIPMENT. HE SAID HIS MAINTENANCE TRAINING WAS ""ON-THE-JOB."" 



THE MECHANIC STATED THAT MAINTENANCE TO THE FUEL SYSTEM WAS PERFORMED AFTER A PILOT, WHO HE SAID WAS PROBABLY A PILOT OTHER THAN THE ACCIDENT PILOT, REPORTED A ""SHUDDER."" HE SAID THAT HE DID NOT KNOW IF THE REPORT WAS MADE ON OCTOBER 4, 2012, AND WHETHER THERE WAS A WRITTEN RECORD OF THAT REPORT. HE SAID THAT WHEN HE WORKED ON THE FUEL SYSTEM, HE DRAINED FUEL FROM THE FUEL TANK UNDER BOTH ACCESS COVERS ON THE FLOOR OF THE CABIN. THE PILOT HELPED HIM REPLACE THE START PUMP AND FLUSH THE FUEL SYSTEM. HE SAID THAT HE REINSTALLED THE SUMP DRAIN AND BOOST PUMP. THE FUEL TANK WAS PARTIALLY FILLED WITH A ""FEW GALLONS"" OF FUEL AND THE BOOST PUMP WAS OPERATED AND FUEL FLOW WAS NOTED. HE SAID THAT THEY REMOVED THE FUEL QUANTITY TRANSMITTER. HE SAID THAT THE PILOT ONLY REMOVED THE FLOOR ACCESS COVERS TO THE FUEL TANK AND HELD A 5-GALLON BUCKET WHEN THEY DRAINED THE FUEL. THE MECHANIC SAID THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT THE HELICOPTER MAINTENANCE MANUAL WHILE HE WAS PERFORMING THE MAINTENANCE ON THE FUEL SYSTEM. THE MECHANIC SAID THAT HE DID NOT PERFORM VACUUM CHECKS OF THE FUEL SYSTEM AND DID NOT KNOW HOW TO PERFORM THOSE CHECKS WITHOUT READING THE MAINTENANCE MANUAL. HE DID NOT PERFORM A VACUUM CHECK AFTER WORKING ON THE FUEL SYSTEM. WHEN ASKED HOW HE CHECKED THE LOW FUEL ANNUNCIATOR LIGHT, THE MECHANIC SAID THAT HE GROUNDED THE FUEL QUANTITY TRANSMITTER BY CONTACTING THE TOP OF THE TRANSMITTER WITH A SAFETY WIRE.



THE MD HELICOPTERS, INC. MAINTENANCE MANUAL, CSP-HMI-2, FUEL SYSTEM INSPECTION/CHECK, PAGE 501, REVISION 44, STATES IN PART, THAT TESTING OF THE FUEL LEVEL LOW WARNING LIGHT IS PERFORMED BY BE REFUELING THE HELICOPTER WITH 35 LBS. OF FUEL REMAINING FOR COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS AND 75 LBS. OF FUEL REMAINING FOR NONCOMMERCIAL MACHINES. WITH THE HELICOPTER BATTERY SWITCH IN THE EXT PWR POSITION AND EXTERNAL POWER CONNECTED, THE FUEL LEVEL LOW WARNING LIGHT MUST BE OFF FOR THESE FUEL REMAINING QUANTITIES.



THE MD HELICOPTERS, INC. MAINTENANCE MANUAL, CSP-HMI-2, FUEL SYSTEM INSPECTION/CHECK, PAGE 601, REVISION 19, STATES IN PART:



""WARNING""

""AIR ENTERING THE AIRFRAME FUEL SUPPLY LINES MAY CAUSE A POWER REDUCTION OR FLAMEOUT. FUEL SYSTEM VACUUM AND FUEL AIR BLEED PROCEDURES MUST BE PERFORMED AFTER OPENING FUEL THE SUPPLY SYSTEM FOR ANY REASON, PRIOR TO RELEASING THE HELICOPTER FOR FLIGHT.""



THE MECHANIC STATED THAT HE DID NOT HAVE ANY SAFETY CONCERNS PERTAINING TO BRIM AVIATION.



ACCORDING TO FAA ORDER 8900.1, VOLUME 6, CHAPTER 5, PARAGRAPH 6-1378, (B), (1), (A), A CURRENT COPY OF THE OPERATOR'S OPERATING CERTIFICATE AND CURRENT AUTHORIZATIONS MUST BE ONBOARD EACH ROTORCRAFT DURING PART 133 OPERATIONS. THE ""BRIM AVIATION ROTORCRAFT-LOAD COMBINATION FLIGHT MANUAL"" (RLCFM) AND ""OPERATIONS SPECIFICATIONS"" THAT WERE ONBOARD THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER AT THE TIME THE ACCIDENT WERE NOT CURRENT AND HAD BEEN AMENDED. THE 12-PAGE RLCFM AND 17-PAGE OPERATIONS SPECIFICATIONS ONBOARD THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WERE APPROVED BY THE FAA'S PORTLAND FLIGHT STANDARDS DISTRICT OFFICE (FSDO). ACCORDING TO THE ONBOARD OPERATIONS SPECIFICATIONS, SECTION A001. ISSUANCE AND APPLICABILITY, ONLY SHOWED APPROVAL FOR THE OPERATOR TO CONDUCT CLASS A, B, AND C EXTERNAL LOAD OPERATIONS. SECTION A003. AIRCRAFT AUTHORIZATION LISTED THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WITH ONLY APPLICABLE LOAD CLASSES A, B, AND C. FAA RECORDS SHOWED THAT THE OPERATOR WAS APPROVED FOR CLASS D OPERATIONS. THE OPERATOR WAS REQUESTED AND PROVIDED A CURRENT COPY OF THEIR OPERATIONS SPECIFICATIONS FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT, WHICH LISTED UNDER SECTION A001, CLASS D EXTERNAL LOAD OPERATIONS. SECTION A003 APPLICABLE LOAD CLASSES WAS BLANK FOR ALL OF THE LISTED AIRCRAFT.



THE ONLY AIRWORTHINESS REQUIREMENTS CITED IN THE ONBOARD AND CURRENT OPERATIONS SPECIFICATIONS WERE IN SECTION A447, EMERGENCY AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVE (EAD) NOTIFICATION, WHICH STATED THAT THE OWNER OR OPERATOR OF AIRCRAFT IDENTIFIED IN THE CERTIFICATE HOLDER OR OPERATOR'S AIRCRAFT LISTING IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE AIRCRAFT IN AN AIRWORTHY CONDITION AS REQUIRED UNDER PARTS 91.403A AND 39. THIS SECTION ALSO SECTION DESIGNATED THE CERTIFICATE HOLDER'S EAD NOTIFICATION REPRESENTATIVE. THERE WERE NO REQUIREMENTS WITHIN THE OPERATIONS SPECIFICATIONS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH SERVICE BULLETINS (SBS).



A SB RELATING TO START PUMP WIRE ROUTING WAS ISSUED BY MD HELICOPTERS ON SEPTEMBER 15, 1987, THAT WAS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHIN 25 HOURS OF HELICOPTER OPERATION OR AT THE NEXT REMOVAL OF THE FUEL START PUMP OR FUEL QUANTITY SENDER UNIT, WHICHEVER OCCURRED FIRST AND AT EACH SUBSEQUENT REMOVAL OF THE START PUMP","THE HELICOPTER WAS IN A HOVER ABOUT 120-150 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND WHILE A UTILITY WORKER PERFORMING A LONG-LINE OPERATION WORKED ON A TRANSMISSION TOWER. AFTER THE LOSS OF POWER, THE HELICOPTER SPUN AND DESCENDED DURING WHICH THE WORKER WAS PULLED OFF THE TOWER BY THE ATTACHED LONG LINE. THE PILOT PERFORMED AN AUTOROTATION THAT RESULTED IN A HARD LANDING. THE PILOT SUSTAINED SERIOUS INJURIES AND THE WORKER SUSTAINED FATAL INJURIES.
POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER REVEALED NO USABLE FUEL ON BOARD, AND FUEL QUANTITIES BETWEEN THE FUEL TANK AND ENGINE WERE CONSISTENT WITH FUEL EXHAUSTION. THE EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT THE ELECTRICAL WIRE TO THE START PUMP WAS NOT SECURED, WHICH ALLOWED FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF  IT INTERFERING WITH THE FUEL QUANTITY TRANSMITTER FLOAT MECHANISM, THUS PROVIDING ERRONEOUS COCKPIT FUEL QUANTITY INDICATIONS TO THE PILOT. THE EXAMINATION ALSO REVEALED THAT THE LOW FUEL QUANTITY ANNUNCIATOR WAS INOPERATIVE DUE TO SEPARATION OF THE FUEL QUANTITY TRANSMITTER’S LOW-LEVEL FUEL WHISKER.
RECENT MAINTENANCE OF THE HELICOPTER’S FUEL SYSTEM BY THE OPERATOR’S MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL INCLUDED THE REPLACEMENT OF THE START PUMP AND TESTING OF THE LOW-LEVEL FUEL LIGHT BY ELECTRICALLY GROUNDING THE TOP OF THE FUEL QUANTITY TRANSMITTER USING SAFETY WIRE. A VACUUM CHECK OF THE FUEL SYSTEM WAS NOT PERFORMED AFTER THE FUEL SYSTEM HAD BEEN OPENED. THE METHOD FOR TESTING THE LOW-LEVEL FUEL LIGHT AND THE LACK OF A VACUUM CHECK WERE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MAINTENANCE MANUAL AND THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER’S SERVICE BULLETIN RELATING TO THE START PUMP INSTALLATION. POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER ALSO REVEALED A NONSTANDARD INSTALLATION OF AN ENGINE MOUNTED FUEL FILTER PETCOCK DRAIN VALVE.
NO WRITTEN COMPANY PROCEDURES AND/OR FUELING RECORDS WERE AVAILABLE THAT REQUIRED PILOTS TO TRACK FUEL LOADING AND TIME-BASED FUEL CONSUMPTION IN ORDER TO DETERMINE TIME REMAINING FOR FLIGHTS AND THEIR TERMINATION. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE HELICOPTER REFUELED WHEN THE FUEL GAUGE INDICATED ABOUT 100 LBS. HOWEVER, HAD THE OPERATOR AND/OR PILOT CALCULATED THE FLIGHT TIME REMAINING BASED ON KNOWN FUEL QUANTITIES THAT WERE INDEPENDENT OF FUEL GAUGE INDICATIONS, THEN ANY FUEL GAUGE INACCURACIES WOULD BE HAVE BECOME APPARENT.","THE IMPROPER MAINTENANCE OF THE HELICOPTER FUEL SYSTEM THAT RESULTED IN ERRONEOUS FUEL GAUGE INDICATIONS AND THE PILOT’S INADEQUATE FUEL MANAGEMENT, BOTH OF WHICH RESULTED IN FUEL EXHAUSTION DURING A LONG-LINE HOVER. ALSO CAUSAL WAS THE LACK OF COMPANY PROCEDURES TO ENSURE ADEQUATE MAINTENANCE AND FUEL PLANNING."

THE ANTITORQUE PEDALS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE COCKPIT REMAINED ATTACHED. CONTINUITY WAS ESTABLISHED FROM THE TAILROTOR THROUGH THE TAILROTOR DRIVE SHAFT, TO THE BREAK IN THE TAILBOOM, AND IN TO THE TRANSMISSION. CONTINUITY WAS ALSO CONFIRMED FROM THE MAIN ROTOR, THROUGH THE TRANSMISSION, TO THE TAILROTOR DRIVE SHAFT. THE CYCLIC REMAINED CONNECTED VIA PUSH-PULL TUBES TO THE MIXER, WHERE PUSH-PULL TUBES WERE SEPARATED ABOUT 1 INCH VERTICALLY OF THE MIXER CONSISTENT WITH OVERSTRESS. THE PUSH-PULL TUBES THEN CONTINUED TO THE SWASHPLATE. THE ANTITORQUE PEDALS REMAINED CONNECTED TO PUSH-PULL TUBES TO THE LOWER BELLCRANK. A PUSH-PULL TUBE HAD SEPARATED ABOUT 18 INCHES VERTICALLY OF THE LOWER BELLCRANK, CONSISTENT WITH OVERSTRESS. BEYOND THE SEPARATION, THE UPPER BELLCRANK WAS FRACTURED AND THERE WAS ALSO A SEPARATION OF A PUSH-PULL TUBE IN THE TAILBOOM. 

THE CARBURETOR HEAT WAS IN THE OFF POSITION. THE MIXTURE CONTROL WAS IN THE FULL RICH POSITION. THE MAGNETOS WERE SELECTED TO BOTH. THE FUEL SELECTOR WAS NOT RECOVERED. 

THE VALVE COVERS AND TOP SPARK PLUGS WERE REMOVED FROM THE ENGINE AND OIL WAS NOTED THROUGHOUT THE ENGINE. THE SPARK PLUG ELECTRODES WERE INTACT AND LIGHT GRAY IN COLOR. THE CAPS WERE ALSO REMOVED FROM THE MAGNETOS. THE CRANKSHAFT WAS ROTATED BY HAND VIA THE FAN WHEEL. CAMSHAFT, CRANKSHAFT, AND VALVE TRAIN CONTINUITY WAS CONFIRMED TO THE REAR ACCESSORY SECTION AND THUMB COMPRESSION WAS ATTAINED ON ALL CYLINDERS. BOTH MAGNETO GEARS ROTATED WHEN THE CRANKSHAFT ROTATED. THE CARBURETOR REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE ENGINE AND WAS UNDAMAGED. 

THE ROTOR HUB AND THE RECOVERED MAIN ROTOR BLADE WITH SPINDLE ASSEMBLY WERE FORWARDED TO THE NTSB MATERIALS LABORATORY, WASHINGTON, D.C., FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION. METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE COMPONENTS REVEALED FEATURES CONSISTENT WITH OVERSTRESS AND NO PREEXISTING CRACKING OR FATIGUE WAS NOTED. ADDITIONALLY, DAMAGE TO THE TEETERING STOPS WAS CONSISTENT WITH A MAST BUMP (FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE MATERIALS LABORATORY FACTUAL REPORTS IN THE NTSB PUBLIC DOCKET.) 

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

AN AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED ON THE PILOT ON DECEMBER 2, 2012, BY THE STATE OF FLORIDA DISTRICT 13 MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE, TAMPA, FLORIDA. THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS NOTED AS DUE TO BLUNT IMPACT TO THE HEAD AND TORSO. TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING WAS PERFORMED ON THE PILOT BY THE FAA BIOAERONAUTICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH LABORATORY, OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA. REVIEW OF THE TOXICOLOGICAL REPORT REVEALED:

""RIZATRIPTAN DETECTED IN URINE
ZOLPIDEM DETECTED IN LIVER
ZOLPIDEM DETECTED IN URINE""

REVIEW OF THE PILOT'S APPLICATIONS FOR FAA MEDICAL CERTIFICATES REVEALED THAT HE WAS FIRST MEDICALLY CERTIFIED IN 1973 AND ROUTINELY MEDICALLY RECERTIFIED THEREAFTER. THE PILOT DID NOT REPORT ANY MEDICATIONS, MEDICAL CONDITIONS, OR PHYSICIAN VISITS UNTIL 2010, WHEN HE REPORTED HAVING HAD HERNIA SURGERY. 

FOR MANY YEARS, THE PILOT'S AVIATION MEDICAL EXAMINER WAS HIS PERSONAL PHYSICIAN. THIS PHYSICIAN HAD PRESCRIBED ZOLPIDEM (A SLEEP AID MARKETED UNDER THE TRADE NAME AMBIEN) FOR MANY YEARS WITH THE CAUTION ""DO NOT FLY AN AIRCRAFT FOR 24 HOURS AFTER TAKING THIS MED."" ACCORDING TO PHARMACY RECORDS, DURING THE LAST FEW MONTHS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, THE PILOT HAD REFILLED THIS PRESCRIPTION MONTHLY FOR 30 TABLETS EACH TIME. IN ADDITION, THE PHYSICIAN HAD REFERRED THE PILOT TO A NEUROLOGIST FOR EVALUATION AND TREATMENT OF MIGRAINE HEADACHES AND WAS AWARE THAT THE PILOT HAD BEEN PRESCRIBED RIZATRIPTAN (A VASOACTIVE MEDICATION USED TO TREAT MIGRAINES, MARKETED UNDER THE TRADE NAME MAXALT) FOR THESE HEADACHES. ACCORDING TO PHARMACY RECORDS, THE PILOT ROUTINELY REFILLED HIS PRESCRIPTION FOR 9 TABLETS/MONTH. ACCORDING TO THE TREATING NEUROLOGIST, THE MIGRAINES WERE SUCCESSFULLY ABORTED BY THIS MEDICATION.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ACCORDING TO THE FAA-H-8083-21A, HELICOPTER FLYING HANDBOOK, ""…MAST BUMPING IS THE RESULT OF EXCESSIVE ROTOR FLAPPING. EACH ROTOR SYSTEM DESIGN HAS A MAXIMUM FLAPPING ANGLE. IF FLAPPING EXCEEDS THE DESIGN VALUE, THE STATIC STOP WILL CONTACT THE MAST. IT IS THE VIOLENT CONTACT BETWEEN THE STATIC STOP AND THE MAST DURING FLIGHT THAT CAUSES MAST DAMAGE OR SEPARATION.""","THE HELICOPTER WAS IN CRUISE FLIGHT ABOUT 500 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL, OVER A BAY BEACH, WHEN BOTH OF ITS MAIN ROTOR BLADES SEPARATED. THE HELICOPTER SUBSEQUENTLY DESCENDED INTO THE BAY, AND THE WRECKAGE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WAS RECOVERED 2 DAYS LATER. ONE MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RECOVERED ABOUT 1 MONTH LATER, AND THE OTHER MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS NOT RECOVERED. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SEPARATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES, EXAMINATION OF THE AIRFRAME AND ENGINE DID NOT REVEAL ANY EVIDENCE OF PREIMPACT MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS OR ANOMALIES. METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE ROTOR HUB AND THE RECOVERED MAIN ROTOR BLADE REVEALED FEATURES CONSISTENT WITH OVERSTRESS, AND NO PREEXISTING CRACKING OR FATIGUE WAS NOTED. ADDITIONALLY, DAMAGE TO THE TEETERING STOPS ON THE ROTOR HUB WAS CONSISTENT WITH MAST BUMPING. THE OBSERVED MAST BUMPING COULD HAVE RESULTED FROM LARGE, ABRUPT FLIGHT CONTROL INPUTS OR FROM A MECHANICAL FAILURE OF THE UNRECOVERED MAIN ROTOR BLADE. 


TOXICOLOGICAL TESTING AND REVIEW OF THE PILOT'S MEDICAL RECORDS REVEALED A HISTORY OF NEAR NIGHTLY USE OF ZOLPIDEM (AMBIEN) AS A SLEEP AID AND FREQUENT USE OF RIZATRIPAN (MAXALT) TO TREAT MIGRAINE HEADACHES. NEITHER CONDITION OR ITS RESPECTIVE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION FOR TREATMENT WAS REPORTED TO THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AND IF IT HAD BEEN, WOULD HAVE MOST LIKELY DISQUALIFIED THE PILOT FOR A MEDICAL CERTIFICATE BASED ON THE FREQUENCY OF USE/SYMPTOMS; HOWEVER, THE INVESTIGATION COULD NOT DETERMINE THE EFFECTS, IF ANY, THAT THE RECURRENT MIGRAINE, CHRONIC ZOLPIDEM USE, AND UNDERLYING SLEEP PROBLEMS MIGHT HAVE HAD ON THE PILOT AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.",MAST BUMPING FOR REASONS THAT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED BECAUSE ONE MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS NOT RECOVERED.

ON MARCH 15, 2013, ABOUT 1147 CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME, A SIKORSKY S-76A++ HELICOPTER, N574EH, WAS DESTROYED AFTER GROUND IMPACT NEAR GRAND LAKE, LOUISIANA. ALL THREE OCCUPANTS ONBOARD, THE PILOT AND TWO MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL, WERE FATALLY INJURED. THE HELICOPTER WAS REGISTERED TO ERA HELICOPTERS LLC AND WAS OPERATING UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS PART 91 AS A POST-MAINTENANCE CHECK FLIGHT OF AVIONICS SYSTEMS. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED FOR THE LOCAL FLIGHT, WHICH DEPARTED FROM LAKE CHARLES REGIONAL AIRPORT (LCH), LAKE CHARLES, LOUISIANA AT 1119.

AT 1120, LCH TOWER CONTROLLER INSTRUCTED THE PILOT TO REPORT INBOUND TO LCH AT THE COMPLETION OF THE MAINTENANCE FLIGHT. THE PILOT ACKNOWLEDGED AND ADVISED HE WOULD REMAIN ON THE LCH AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC) FREQUENCY. AT 1145, THE PILOT ADVISED LCH ATC THAT HE WAS ABOUT 10 MILES TO THE SOUTH OF LCH AND WOULD BE RETURNING FOR LANDING. 

AT 1146:57, THE PILOT CALLED LCH TOWER CONTROLLER AND ADVISED HE HAD AN EMERGENCY AND WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY LANDING OFF THE AIRPORT. AT 11:47:02, THE PILOT CALLED THE ERA HELICOPTERS COMPANY DISPATCHER AND ADVISED THAT HE HAD A PROBLEM AND WOULD BE LANDING IMMEDIATELY. THE WRECKAGE OF THE HELICOPTER WAS FOUND ABOUT 5 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE THRESHOLD FOR RUNWAY 33 AT LCH. THE MAJORITY OF THE HELICOPTER WAS CONSUMED BY A POST-CRASH FIRE.

SEVERAL WITNESSES NOTICED THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER AS IT FLEW TOWARD THE ACCIDENT SITE. THE FIRST WITNESS, A HELICOPTER PILOT, STATED THAT HE OBSERVED THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER IN A SHALLOW DESCENT AS IT PASSED JUST EAST OF HIS HOUSE ABOUT 600 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL. HE STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS PRODUCING AN UNUSUAL, GRINDING NOISE AS IT PASSED OVER HIS HOUSE. AFTER WATCHING THE HELICOPTER PASS BY HIS HOUSE, HE WALKED INSIDE HIS HOUSE TO AVOID DIRECTLY VIEWING A POSSIBLE CRASH. AS HE WALKED BACK OUTSIDE, HE NOTICED SMOKE PLUMES TO THE NORTH OF HIS HOUSE.

A SECOND WITNESS, A PREVIOUS NAVY HELICOPTER MECHANIC, RECORDED A CELL PHONE VIDEO OF THE HELICOPTER AS IT PASSED BY HIS POSITION. HE STATED THE HELICOPTER'S ROTOR SYSTEM SOUNDED ABNORMAL AS IT FLEW BY, MAKING A LOUD, SCREECHING NOISE. HE STATED THE HELICOPTER APPEARED TO SLOW DOWN, THEN THE HELICOPTER'S TAIL ROSE UP AND IT STARTED TO SPIN. HE HEARD A LOUD BOOM AND SAW A PLUME OF SMOKE. 
A THIRD WITNESS STATED THE HELICOPTER WAS MAKING A WHISTLING TYPE OF NOISE AS IT FLEW TOWARD LCH. AT ABOUT 100 TO 150 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND, HE NOTICED THE HELICOPTER PITCH DOWN AND THEN SPIN FOR ABOUT FIVE REVOLUTIONS. HE STATED THAT HE DID NOT HEAR ANY NOISE FROM THE HELICOPTER AS IT WAS SPINNING. AFTER THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED THE GROUND, HE NOTICED FLAMES AND SMOKE.
A MAP OF WITNESS LOCATIONS AND THE HELICOPTER'S FLIGHT PATH IS LOCATED IN THE DOCKET FOR THIS INVESTIGATION.

DUAL ENGINE FAILURE/AUTOROTATION AND TAIL ROTOR MALFUNCTIONS WERE ACCOMPLISHED DURING THIS RECURRENT TRAINING. 
ON APRIL 2, 2012, THE PILOT WAS ISSUED A CLASS 1 TIME LIMITED SPECIAL ISSUANCE MEDICAL CERTIFICATE, WHICH REQUIRED CORRECTIVE LENSES BE WORN FOR NEAR VISION. DURING THE LAST EXAMINATION, THE PILOT WAS EVALUATED FOR HIS HISTORY OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ANGINA PECTORIS AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE REQUIRING PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL ANGIOPLASTY, HYPOTHYROIDISM, AND THE USE OF MEDICATION. 


AIRCRAFT INFORMATION


THE SIKORSKY S-76A++ HELICOPTER HAS A FOUR-BLADED, FULLY ARTICULATED MAIN ROTOR THAT PROVIDES HELICOPTER LIFT AND THRUST, AND A FOUR-BLADED FLEXIBLE BEAM TAIL ROTOR (SPAR) THAT PROVIDES MAIN ROTOR ANTI-TORQUE AND DIRECTIONAL CONTROL. THE HELICOPTER IS EQUIPPED WITH TWO TURBOMECA ARRIEL 1S1 TURBOSHAFT ENGINES THAT ARE POSITIONED SIDE-BY-SIDE BEHIND THE MAIN TRANSMISSION ASSEMBLY. 
THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER, SERIAL NUMBER (S/N) 760369, WAS MANUFACTURED IN 1990. RECORDS SHOW THE HELICOPTER HAD ACCUMULATED AN AIRCRAFT TOTAL TIME (ATT) OF 6,765.7 HOURS AS OF MARCH 15, 2013. THE NO. 1 ENGINE, S/N 3016, HAD A TIME SINCE NEW (TSN) OF 8361.10 HOURS AND A TIME SINCE OVERHAUL (TSO) OF 1475.11 HOURS AS OF MARCH 15, 2013. THE NO. 2 ENGINE, S/N 3508TEC, HAD A TSN OF 6696.80 HOURS AND A TSO OF 1287.50 HOURS AS OF MARCH 15, 2013.


METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION


THE WEATHER OBSERVING STATION AT LCH REPORTED THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS AT 1153: WIND 180 DEGREES AT 13 KNOTS WITH GUSTS TO 19 KNOTS, VISIBILITY 10 MILES, CLEAR SKIES, TEMPERATURE 23 DEGREES CELSIUS, DEW POINT 14 DEGREES CELSIUS, ALTIMETER SETTING 30.05. 


FLIGHT RECORDERS


A SOLID-STATE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER (CVR), MODEL L3/FAIRCHILD FA2100-1020, WAS RECOVERED AT THE ACCIDENT SITE AND SENT TO THE NTSB AUDIO LABORATORY FOR READOUT. TIMING OF THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT CVR RECORDING WAS ALIGNED WITH TIMING INFORMATION PROVIDED BY A TIME-ENCODED ATC RECORDING. OTHER TRANSMISSIONS IN THE CVR RECORDING WERE USED TO VALIDATE THE ALIGNMENT OF THE TWO RECORDINGS. 
A SUMMARY OF THE CVR IS AS FOLLOWS:
1113: THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT RECORDING BEGAN, WITH A SOUND SIMILAR TO AN ENGINE STARTING.
1115: THE PILOT AND A MECHANIC NOTED THAT THE AUTOMATIC FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM (AFCS) TEST PASSED WITH NO FAULTS.
1120: THE MECHANIC NOTED THAT THEY NEEDED TO DO A POWER CHECK WHEN THEY RETURNED. THE PILOT AGREED.
1127: THE MECHANIC ASKED IF HE COULD FLY AFTER THE MAINTENANCE CHECKS.
1127-1142: THE PILOT PERFORMED A SERIES OF TURNS, CLIMBS, AND DESCENTS TO CHECK THE AVIONICS, FLIGHT DIRECTORS, AND AUTOPILOT SYSTEMS. THE PILOT AND MECHANIC AGREED ONE OF THE TWO FLIGHT DIRECTORS MAY HAVE HAD A REMAINING PROBLEM.
1142: THE PILOT ASKED THE MECHANIC IF HE WANTED TO FLY THE HELICOPTER. THE MECHANIC AGREED, AND THE PILOT SAID HE WOULD SET THE HELICOPTER UP FOR THE MECHANIC ON A HEADING OF 150 DEGREES AT AN ALTITUDE OF 1,000 FEET. THE MECHANIC NOTED THE HELICOPTER WAS NOT LIKE THE CESSNA 172 HE HAD FLOWN.
1143:00: THE PILOT SAID TO THE MECHANIC, ""IT IS ALL YOURS…DO ANYTHING YOU WANT WITH IT.""
1143:06: THE MECHANIC ASKED IF HE NEEDED TO USE THE PEDALS. THE PILOT SAID ONLY DURING POWER CHANGES.
1143:17: TWO HIGH PITCHED TONES, SIMILAR TO AN ALTITUDE ALERT, WERE RECORDED.
1143:42: THE MECHANIC SAID ""NOT QUITE AS TOUCHY AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.""
1143:45: THE PILOT SAID, ""OH THAT'S BECAUSE I'VE GOT EVERYTHING TURN ON.""
1143:55: THE PILOT SAID, ""WHAT WE'LL DO, WE'LL TAKE THESE AUTOPILOTS OFF. TAKE OUR FORCED TRIM OFF.""
1144:04: THE MECHANIC SAID, ""OH YEA, THERE WE GO; NOW I'M FLYING SOMETHING. OKAY."" 
1144:10: THE MECHANIC SAID, ""OKAY, YOU GOT HER.""
1144:12: TWO OR THREE SNAPPING SOUNDS WERE RECORDED ON THE INTERCOM. AT THE SAME TIME, THE COCKPIT AREA MICROPHONE RECORDED A SOUND SIMILAR TO THE ROTOR OR ENGINE RPM INCREASING. THE TWO OR THREE SNAPPING SOUNDS, ABOUT 0.25 SECONDS IN LENGTH, MAY HAVE BEEN A VIRTUAL ARTIFACT OF THE POWER REMOVAL FROM THE CVR AND NOT A PHYSICAL SOUND THAT EXISTED IN THE HELICOPTER. 
1144:13: THE CVR RECORDING ENDED.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION


REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB), FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA), SIKORSKY AIRCRAFT CORPORATION (SAC), AND ERA HELICOPTERS WERE PRESENT FOR THE DOCUMENTATION AND INVESTIGATION OF THE HELICOPTER ACCIDENT SITE. OF THE FOUR TAIL ROTOR BLADES, TWO OF THE TAIL ROTOR BLADES ('YELLOW' AND 'RED') WERE FRACTURED ADJACENT TO THE TAIL ROTOR HUB; AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT, THESE TWO TAIL ROTOR BLADES HAVE NOT BEEN LOCATED AND RECOVERED. 

THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST UPRIGHT ON A SOUTHERLY HEADING. THE MAJORITY OF THE AIRFRAME, INCLUDING THE COCKPIT, MAIN CABIN, AND FORWARD PORTION OF THE TAILBOOM, WAS EITHER CONSUMED OR HEAVILY HEAT DISTRESSED BY THE POST-CRASH FIRE.

THREE OF THE FOUR MAIN ROTOR BLADES REMAINED CONNECTED TO THE MAIN ROTOR HUB AND THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE SPINDLES WERE ORIENTED AT ABOUT 11 O'CLOCK, 2 O'CLOCK, 5 O'CLOCK, AND 8 O'CLOCK POSITIONS WHEN VIEWED FROM ABOVE. THE 11 O'CLOCK BLADE HAD FRACTURED CHORDWISE OUTBOARD OF ITS PITCH HORN BUT WAS FOUND ADJACENT TO THE MAIN WRECKAGE ABOUT 6 FEET AWAY. ALL FOUR MAIN ROTOR BLADES EXHIBITED EVIDENCE CONSISTENT WITH LOW ROTATIONAL ENERGY AT GROUND IMPACT. THE 5 O'CLOCK AND 11 O'CLOCK BLADES EXHIBITED SEVERE CHORDWISE DEFORMATION OF THE SPAR CONSISTENT WITH EXPOSURE TO EXTREME HEAT. THE TIP CAP FOR THE 5 O'CLOCK BLADE WAS FOUND SEPARATED FROM THE BLADE AND WAS FOUND ABOUT 12 FEET TO THE EAST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.

THE MAJORITY OF THE MAIN TRANSMISSION CASE WAS CONSUMED BY POST-CRASH FIRE, EXPOSING ITS INTERNAL GEARS WHICH EXHIBITED EVIDENCE OF EXPOSURE TO EXTREME HEAT. THE MAIN ROTOR CONTROLS WERE CONTINUOUS FROM THE THREE MAIN ROTOR HYDRAULIC ACTUATORS' LOWER ATTACHMENT FITTINGS THROUGH THE SWASHPLATE AND UP TO THE PITCH CONTROL RODS' CONNECTION TO THE PITCH HORNS. THE MAIN ROTOR CONTROLS FORWARD OF THE HYDRAULIC ACTUATORS WERE CONSUMED BY POST-CRASH FIRE, THUS ITS CONTINUITY COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED.

THE TWO ENGINES WERE FOUND BEHIND THE MAIN TRANSMISSION AND WERE STILL COVERED BY THE ENGINE COWLING. BOTH ENGINES EXHIBITED EVIDENCE OF EXPOSURE TO THE POST-CRASH FIRE. NEITHER ENGINE'S AXIAL COMPRESSOR SHOWED EVIDENCE OF FOREIGN OBJECT DEBRIS INGESTION. ADDITIONALLY, NEITHER ENGINE'S FREE TURBINE EXHIBITED EVIDENCE OF BLADE SHEDDING. THE FUEL CONTROL UNIT THROTTLE BLOCK REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE CABLE AND THE POINTER WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE SHUTDOWN POSITION, BUT THE THROTTLE SCALE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY POST-CRASH FIRE. 

THE EMPENNAGE, CONSISTING OF THE VERTICAL STABILIZER AND THE LEFT AND RIGHT HORIZONTAL STABILIZERS, WAS FOUND IMMEDIATELY AFT OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE, AND GENERALLY ALIGNED WITH LONGITUDINAL AXIS OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE. THE EMPENNAGE WAS FOUND RESTING ON ITS LEFT SIDE (I.E. THE RIGHT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER WAS POINTED ALMOST VERTICALLY UPWARD) WITH THE LEFT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER FRACTURED CHORDWISE ADJACENT TO THE VERTICAL STABILIZER. THE EMPENNAGE DID NOT EXHIBIT EVIDENCE OF HEAT DAMAGE APART FROM THE FORWARD END WHICH CONNECTED IT TO THE HEAT-DISTRESSED TAILBOOM. THE SURFACES OF THE EMPENNAGE WHICH WERE NOT HEAT DAMAGED DID NOT EXHIBIT EVIDENCE OF SOOT DEPOSITS. 

ONLY TWO OF THE FOUR TAIL ROTOR BLADES (THE 'BLACK' AND 'BLUE' BLADES) WERE RECOVERED AT THE ACCIDENT SITE. THE 'BLACK' BLADE HAD FRACTURED FROM THE 'BLACK'/'BLUE' TAIL ROTOR SPAR WHILE THE 'BLUE' BLADE REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE SPAR. THE 'BLUE' AND 'BLACK' BLADE SURFACES WERE MOSTLY INTACT AND DID NOT EXHIBIT SIGNATURES OF DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH ROTATIONAL ENERGY. THE 'BLACK' AND 'BLUE' PITCH CHANGE LINKS (PCL) REMAINED ATTACHED ON BOTH ENDS TO THE PITCH BEAM AND THEIR RESPECTIVE BLADE PITCH HORNS. 

THE 'RED' PCL HAD FRACTURED AT THE PITCH BEAM-SIDE THREADS AND THE REMAINDER OF THE 'RED' PCL WAS NOT RECOVERED. THE REMNANT 'RED' PCL REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE PITCH BEAM. THE 'YELLOW' PCL REMAINED WHOLE AND ATTACHED ON ITS OUTBOARD END TO THE PITCH BEAM, BUT THE INBOARD ROD END WAS OBSERVED TO BE FREE. THE BOLT AND NUT CONNECTING THE 'YELLOW' PCL TO ITS RESPECTIVE BLADE PITCH HORN WERE NOT RECOVERED. 

DISASSEMBLY OF THE PITCH BEAM AND OUTBOARD RETENTION PLATE REVEALED THE 'RED'/'YELLOW' TAIL ROTOR SPAR HAD SHIFTED TOWARD THE 'YELLOW' BLADE SIDE BY EVIDENCE OF THE SHIFTED SPAR NYLON WRAPS. THE ELLIPTICAL PLUG OF THE 'RED'/'YELLOW' SPAR EXHIBITED CRUSHING DAMAGE ON THE 'RED' BLADE SIDE, WITH THE DIRECTION OF CRUSHING GOING TOWARD THE 'YELLOW' BLADE SIDE.

THE INTERMEDIATE GEARBOX, TAIL GEARBOX (TGB), TAIL ROTOR HEAD COMPONENTS, TAIL ROTOR BLADES, ROTOR BRAKE, AND THE NOS. 3, 4, AND 5 TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFTS WERE RETAINED FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE WRECKAGE, SEE THE AIRWORTHINESS GROUP CHAIRMAN'S FACTUAL REPORT IN THE DOCKET FOR THIS INVESTIGATION.


MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION


ON MARCH 16, 2013, AN AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED ON THE PILOT AT THE CALCASIEU PARISH CORONER'S OFFICE AND FORENSIC FACILITY. THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS DUE TO BLUNT FORCE INJURIES. 

THE FAA'S CIVIL AEROMEDICAL INSTITUTE IN OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, PERFORMED TOXICOLOGY TESTS ON THE PILOT, WHICH WAS LIMITED BY SPECIMENS SUITABLE FOR TESTING. NO ETHANOL WAS DETECTED IN THE MUSCLE OR BRAIN. ATORVASTATIN (LIPITOR), A LIPID LOWERING AGENT USED TO TREAT LIPID DISORDERS AND ELEVATED CHOLESTEROL, WAS DETECTED IN THE LIVER. CARVEDILIOL (COREG), A PRESCRIPTION NONSELECTIVE SS-ADRENERGIC BLOCKING AGENT USED TO TREAT HEART FAILURE AND HYPERTENSION (HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE), WAS DETECTED IN THE MUSCLE AND LIVER. DILTIAZEM (CARDIZEM), A PRESCRIPTION CALCIUM ION CELLULAR INFLUX INHIBITOR USED TO TREAT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND ANGINA, WAS DETECTED IN THE LIVER. 

REVIEW OF AVAILABLE FAA MEDICAL CERTIFICATES AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PILOT HAD A REMOTE HEART ATTACK TREATED WITH ANGIOPLASTY (OPENING OF CORONARY ARTERIES WITH A BALLOON) AND ONGOING TREATMENT WITH MEDICATION. ON JANUARY 25, 2012, A RADIONUCLIDE STRESS TEST WAS CONDUCTED ON THE PILOT AND READ NORMAL. ON MARCH 6, 2013, AN EXERCISE STRESS TEST/STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAM WAS CONDUCTED ON THE PILOT AND READ NORMAL, WITH NORMAL WALL MOTION AND NO EVIDENCE OF ISCHEMIA. 


TESTS AND RESEARCH


FROM APRIL 9-11, 2013, THE AIRWORTHINESS GROUP, CONSISTING OF PARTICIPANTS FROM THE NTSB, FAA, SAC, AND ERA HELICOPTERS, CONVENED TO FURTHER EXAMINE THE RETAINED COMPONENTS. THE EXAMINATION REVEALED SIGNATURES CONSISTENT WITH THE 'RED' TAIL ROTOR BLADE INITIALLY SEPARATING FROM THE TAIL ROTOR ASSEMBLY, FOLLOWED BY THE 'YELLOW' TAIL ROTOR BLADE SEPARATING FROM THE TAIL ROTOR ASSEMBLY DUE TO FORCES CAUSED BY THE SHIFT IN THE CENTER OF MASS ALONG THE SPAN OF THE 'RED'/'YELLOW' TAIL ROTOR BLADE SPAR.

THE SPAR FRACTURE LOCATED NEAR THE ROOT END OF THE 'RED' TAIL ROTOR SPAR WAS ADJACENT TO THE 'RED' BLADE'S BUMPER PLATE. THE AREA OF THE 'RED' SIDE BUMPER PLATE EXHIBITED A SLIGHT BOWING IN THE OUTBOARD DIRECTION (WHEN LOOKING OUTBOARD FROM THE PYLON-SIDE OF THE SPAR). THE REMNANT ADHESIVE LAYOUT FOR THE 'RED' BLADE'S PIVOT BEARING RETAINER WAS OBSERVED ON THE SPAR FRACTURE. 

EXAMINATION OF THE REMNANT ADHESIVE LAYOUT UNDER A SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE (SEM) REVEALED NO DEFINITIVE DIRECTION THAT THE LAYOUT FIBERS WERE PULLED. THE FRACTURE HAD A BROOMSTRAW APPEARANCE, WITH THE BROOMSTRAW APPEARANCE MORE PREVALENT NEAR THE CENTRAL WIDTH OF THE SPAR. EXAMINATION OF THE FRACTURE UNDER A SEM REVEALED NO EVIDENCE CONSISTENT WITH COMPOSITE MATRIX RUBBING DUE TO DELAMINATION. 
THE OPPOSING SPAR FRACTURE ON THE 'YELLOW' SIDE WAS LOCATED NEAR THE EDGE OF THE RETENTION PLATE. THE 'RED'/'YELLOW' SPAR HAD S/N ""A-116-01207"" STENCILED ON THE SURFACE OF THE SPAR. THE SPAR FRACTURE HAD AN OVERALL BLUNT AND FLAT APPEARANCE.

X-RAY EXAMINATION OF THE REMNANT 'RED'/'YELLOW' SPAR AND THE 'BLACK'/'BLUE' SPAR SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF ""WAVINESS"" OF THE COMPOSITE FILAMENTS IN THE UNDAMAGED AREAS. THE 'BLACK' AND THE 'BLUE' TAIL ROTOR BLADES EXHIBITED NO EVIDENCE OF DAMAGE CONSISTENT WITH HIGH ROTATIONAL ENERGY AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.

THE TGB WAS EXAMINED AND CONTAINED ONLY TRACES OF OIL. NO OIL SAMPLE WAS SUBMITTED WITH THE TGB. THE TGB WAS NOT DRAINED OF OIL WHEN IT WAS RECOVERED AT THE ACCIDENT SITE.

THE OUTPUT HOUSING OF THE TGB, CONTAINING THE OUTPUT BEVEL GEAR, WAS SEPARATED FROM THE CENTER HOUSING; THE MOUNTING HARDWARE FOR THE TAIL ROTOR QUADRANT, SPRING CAPSULES, AND PULLEYS WERE HOLDING THE OUTPUT HOUSING TO THE CENTER HOUSING. ROTATION OF THE INPUT PINION BY HAND DID NOT ENGAGE THE OUTPUT BEVEL GEAR. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF BINDING WHEN THE INPUT PINION WAS ROTATED. ROTATION OF THE OUTPUT BEVEL GEAR BY HAND REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF BINDING. THE PITCH CHANGE SHAFT ROTATED IN UNISON WITH THE OUTPUT BEVEL GEAR. THE TGB EXHIB","THE PILOT AND TWO MECHANICS WERE CONDUCTING A POST-MAINTENANCE CHECK FLIGHT OF THE HELICOPTER’S AVIONICS SYSTEM. AFTER TESTING THE AVIONICS, THE PILOT ALLOWED THE MECHANIC TO FLY THE HELICOPTER AT 1,000 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL. THE MECHANIC MANEUVERED THE HELICOPTER FOR ABOUT 1 MINUTE AND THEN STATED THAT HE WAS TRANSFERRING CONTROL OF THE HELICOPTER BACK TO THE PILOT. TWO SECONDS LATER, THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER (CVR) CUT OFF. ABOUT 1 MINUTE AFTER THE CVR CUT OFF, THE PILOT MADE A ROUTINE RADIO CALL TO THE TOWER CONTROLLER THAT HE WAS RETURNING TO LAND. TWO MINUTES AFTER THIS CALL, THE PILOT RADIOED THE TOWER CONTROLLER AND HIS COMPANY’S DISPATCHER, STATING THAT HE HAD A PROBLEM AND WOULD BE LANDING OFF-AIRPORT IMMEDIATELY. SEVERAL GROUND WITNESSES NOTICED THE HELICOPTER AS IT FLEW TOWARD THE ACCIDENT SITE, AND IT WAS MAKING AN UNUSUAL NOISE, DESCRIBED AS GRINDING, SCREECHING, OR WHISTLING. THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED WITH A HIGH VERTICAL DESCENT RATE AND A POSTCRASH FIRE ENSUED.
EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER REVEALED THAT THE MAIN ROTOR AND TAIL ROTOR SYSTEMS HAD LOW ROTATIONAL ENERGY AT THE TIME OF GROUND IMPACT. TWO OF THE TAIL ROTOR BLADES (YELLOW AND RED) WERE FRACTURED ADJACENT TO THE TAIL ROTOR HUB. THE FRACTURE SIGNATURES ON THE RED/YELLOW TAIL ROTOR SPAR ASSEMBLY WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE RED TAIL ROTOR BLADE SPAR INITIALLY FRACTURING AND THE RED TAIL ROTOR BLADE DEPARTING FROM THE TAIL ROTOR. 
THE RESULTANT IMBALANCE OF THE TAIL ROTOR FRACTURED THE TAIL GEARBOX (TGB) OUTPUT HOUSING STUDS AND MOST LIKELY TRIPPED THE CVR G-SWITCH, WHICH CUT OFF THE CVR. THE YELLOW TAIL ROTOR BLADE SPAR FRACTURED DUE TO HIGH CENTRIFUGAL FORCES AS A RESULT OF THE IMBALANCE, AND THE YELLOW BLADE DEPARTED FROM THE TAIL ROTOR; THE TAIL ROTOR WAS THEN REBALANCED. THE TWO REMAINING TAIL ROTOR BLADES CONTINUED TO PROVIDE PARTIAL TAIL ROTOR ANTI-TORQUE, AND TAIL ROTOR DRIVE REMAINED CONTINUOUS THROUGH THE TGB. THE ENTIRETY OF THE RED AND YELLOW BLADE SEPARATION EVENT LIKELY OCCURRED VERY QUICKLY, WITH ONLY A MOMENTARY BUMP OR VIBRATION AT THE TIME OF BLADE SEPARATION.   
AS THE TGB OUTPUT HOUSING BEGAN TO SEPARATE FROM THE CENTER HOUSING, THE GEARS LIKELY BEGAN GOING OUT OF MESH, ALLOWING THE OUTPUT BEVEL GEAR TO EVENTUALLY CONTACT THE TGB CENTER HOUSING. THIS CONDITION LIKELY RESULTED IN THE LOUD, UNUSUAL NOISE REPORTED BY WITNESSES, AS WELL AS A DRAG FORCE ON THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SYSTEM. AS THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO LAND, HE LIKELY SHUT THE ENGINES DOWN IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN AUTOROTATIVE LANDING. BECAUSE THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SYSTEM AND MAIN TRANSMISSION REMAINED MECHANICALLY LINKED, WHEN THE ENGINES WERE SHUT DOWN, IT IS LIKELY THAT MAIN ROTOR SPEED (NR) DEGRADED DUE TO THE COMPROMISED TGB. AS A RESULT, THE HELICOPTER DEVELOPED A HIGH VERTICAL DESCENT RATE UNTIL GROUND IMPACT. 
THE RED BLADE SPAR FRACTURE SIGNATURES WERE CONSISTENT WITH A FAST-GROWTH FAILURE MODE. PLAUSIBLE FAST-GROWTH FAILURE MODES THAT WERE EXAMINED INCLUDED A DISCRETE IMPACT EVENT (E.G. OBJECT STRIKE), ANOMALOUS OPERATION OF THE PIVOT BEARING, AND A FRACTURE OF THE PITCH HORN BOX (THE STRUCTURE WHICH ATTACHES THE PITCH HORN TO THE BLADE AND TO WHICH THE PIVOT BEARINGS AND BUMPER ATTACHES). WITH THE LACK OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE BECAUSE THE RED BLADE WAS  NOT RECOVERED, THE SPECIFIC FAILURE MODE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED DURING THE INVESTIGATION.","FRACTURE OF THE RED TAIL ROTOR BLADE SPAR, WHICH RESULTED IN THE SEPARATION AND DEPARTURE OF THE RED TAIL ROTOR BLADE FROM THE HELICOPTER AND SUBSEQUENT COMPROMISED TAIL GEARBOX. THE RED TAIL ROTOR BLADE WAS NOT RECOVERED, THUS THE CAUSE OF THE INITIAL FRACTURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED."

ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2013, ABOUT 1535 PACIFIC DAYLIGHT TIME, A GARLICK UH-1B, N204UH, EXPERIENCED A TAILBOOM SEPARATION WHILE LOGGING IN HEAVILY WOODED TERRAIN ABOUT 3 MILES EAST OF DETROIT, OREGON.  THE PILOT, WHO WAS THE SOLE OCCUPANT ON BOARD, WAS FATALLY INJURED.  THE HELICOPTER SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE TO THE TAILBOOM, MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM, AND FUSELAGE.  THE HELICOPTER WAS REGISTERED TO GITMO HOLDINGS LLC, STEVENSVILLE, MONTANA, AND OPERATED BY R&R CONNER UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS PART 133 AS AN EXTERNAL LOAD LOGGING FLIGHT.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED FOR THE FLIGHT, AND NO FLIGHT PLAN HAD BEEN FILED.  THE FLIGHT ORIGINATED AT ABOUT 1500.  

WITNESSES REPORTED THAT WHEN THE HELICOPTER WAS JUST ABOVE THE TREES, THEY EITHER OBSERVED OR HEARD THE LOAD OF LOGS RELEASE EARLY AND IMPACT THE GROUND HARD.  AFTER LOOKING UP, THEY OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER'S FUSELAGE SEPARATE FROM THE TAILBOOM; BOTH DESCENDING THROUGH THE TREES. THE FUSELAGE IMPACTED THE GROUND INVERTED AND THE TAILBOOM CAME TO REST ABOUT 140 FEET AWAY. 

A MAINTENANCE WORKER REPORTED THAT SHORTLY BEFORE THE FLIGHT, THE PILOT HAD LANDED AND SHUT DOWN THE HELICOPTER FOR ABOUT A 45 MINUTE LUNCH BREAK.  THE PILOT LOOKED OVER THE HELICOPTER AND SAID HE WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT; HE SAID IT WAS RUNNING REALLY WELL. 

PERSONNEL INFORMATION

THE PILOT, AGE 53, HELD A COMMERCIAL PILOT CERTIFICATE IN HELICOPTER, AIRPLANE SINGLE-, AND MULTI-ENGINE LAND, ISSUED ON APRIL 27, 2010. THE PILOT ALSO HELD AN INSTRUMENT RATING IN BOTH HELICOPTER AND AIRPLANE. THE PILOT HELD A SECOND-CLASS MEDICAL CERTIFICATE ISSUED ON FEBRUARY 12, 2013, WITH THE LIMITATIONS THAT HE IS NOT VALID FOR ANY CLASS AFTER, AND HE MUST WEAR CORRECTIVE LENSES. ACCORDING TO THE PILOT'S US FOREST SERVICE HELICOPTER PILOT QUALIFICATIONS AND APPROVAL RECORDS DATED JULY 17, 2013, HE REPORTED HAVING 19,000 TOTAL HELICOPTER HOURS, 14,000 OF WHICH WERE IN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER MAKE AND MODEL.  

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

THE GARLICK HELICOPTER, SERIAL NUMBER 62-2034, WAS MANUFACTURED BY BELL HELICOPTER AS SERIAL NUMBER 554 IN 1962. IT WAS POWERED BY A T53-L13BA ENGINE. THE MAINTENANCE LOGBOOK RECORDS WERE FOUND WITHIN THE HELICOPTER. THE RECORDS DID NOT CONTAIN DATES OR AIRCRAFT TOTAL TIME, THEREFORE, THE MOST RECENT MAINTENANCE WAS UNABLE TO BE DETERMINED. THE DOCUMENTS DID REVEAL THAT SEVERAL COMPONENT INSPECTIONS WERE NOT COMPLETED WITHIN THE MANUFACTURER'S RECOMMENDED TIME. DURING THE POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION, THE HOBBS METER WAS LOCATED AND READ 6,061.3 HOURS. 

ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA), THE PREVIOUS OWNER RELINQUISHED THE AIRCRAFT'S AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATE TO AVOID PUNITIVE ACTION BY THE FAA, WHO HAD BEEN TRYING TO REVOKE THE AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATE DUE TO THE OWNER'S POOR MAINTENANCE OF THE AIRCRAFT. IN 2010, A NEW AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATE WAS ISSUED FOR THE HELICOPTER TO THE ACCIDENT PILOT. 

A DIFFERENT MECHANIC REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER HAD RECENTLY SAT UNUSED FOR ABOUT ONE MONTH BETWEEN JOBS. THE HELICOPTER WAS PUT BACK IN SERVICE THE DAY BEFORE THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED. THE MECHANIC MENTIONED THAT THE PILOT HAD PREVIOUSLY INDICATED THE HELICOPTER FELT LIKE IT ""SHUFFLED"" DURING TRANSLATIONAL LIFT; HOWEVER, THE MECHANIC SUSPECTED THE TRANSMISSION MOUNTS WERE STARTING TO WEAR AND WOULD NEED TO BE CHANGED AT A LATER DATE.

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

THE NEAREST WEATHER REPORTING STATION WAS ABOUT 38 MILES TO THE NORTHWEST AT MCNARY FIELD AIRPORT IN SALEM, OREGON AT AN ELEVATION OF 214 FEET. AT 1556, THE WEATHER WAS REPORTED AS WIND FROM 130 DEGREES AS 3 KNOTS, VISIBILITY 10 STATUTE MILES, BROKEN CLOUDS AT 4,900 AND OVERCAST CLOUDS AT 5,500 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL (AGL), TEMPERATURE 21 DEGREES C, DEWPOINT 13 DEGREES C, AND AN ALTIMETER SETTING OF 29.94 INCHES OF MERCURY. IN THE REMARKS SECTION IT STATED THAT RAIN STARTED AT 1537 HOURS AND ENDED AT 1552 HOURS. 

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

ON SCENE EXAMINATION BY A FAA INSPECTOR REVEALED THAT THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF A NORTHWEST/SOUTHEAST ORIENTATED DIRT ROAD FROM THE LOG LANDING SITE.  THE TERRAIN WAS HILLY, HEAVILY WOODED, AND REMOTE.  THE TREES AROUND THE ACCIDENT SITE SUSTAINED LIMITED DAMAGE; ONE TREE WAS TOPPED AND OTHERS SUSTAINED VERTICAL SCRAPES DOWN THE TRUNKS.  

THE WRECKAGE DEBRIS PATH EXTENDED ALMOST PARALLEL TO THE DIRT ROAD; THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST IN FOUR MAJOR PIECES THE FUSELAGE/TRANSMISSION, ENGINE, MAIN ROTOR BLADES, AND TAILBOOM. THE FUSELAGE AND TRANSMISSION WERE FOUND UPSIDE DOWN AT THE SOUTHEASTERN MOST POINT OF THE WRECKAGE PATH.  THE ENGINE WAS FOUND IN THE SAME GENERAL VICINITY AS THE FUSELAGE. THE MAIN ROTOR HEAD AND BLADES WERE SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN ROTOR SHAFT, AND WERE LOCATED ABOUT 120 FEET NORTHWEST OF THE MAIN FUSELAGE. ONE OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WAS EMBEDDED INTO THE GROUND AND EXTENDED THE SECOND BLADE INTO THE AIR AT ABOUT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE. THE TAILBOOM WAS SEPARATED FROM THE FUSELAGE AND WAS LOCATED 140 FEET NORTHWEST OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES. THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX, ASSEMBLY, AND TAIL ROTOR BLADES WERE STILL ATTACHED TO THE VERTICAL FIN.  ONE TAIL ROTOR BLADE REMAINED MOSTLY UNDAMAGED; THE SECOND TAIL ROTOR BLADE SUSTAINED A 45 DEGREE BEND AWAY FROM THE VERTICAL FIN.  

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

AN AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED ON THE PILOT ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2013 BY THE OFFICE OF THE STATE MEDICAL EXAMINER, CLACKAMAS, OREGON. THE PILOT'S CAUSE OF DEATH WAS BLUNT FORCE HEAD TRAUMA. 

THE FAA CIVIL AEROSPACE MEDICAL INSTITUTE PERFORMED FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY ON SPECIMENS FROM THE PILOT WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS FOR CARBON MONOXIDE AND ETHANOL. ROSUVASTATIN, WHICH IS USED TO TREAT HIGH CHOLESTEROL AND RELATED CONDITIONS, WAS DETECTED IN THE BLOOD AND LIVER. 

TESTS AND RESEARCH

A POST ACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE AIRFRAME AND ENGINE OCCURRED IN DALLAS, OREGON ON JANUARY 29, 2014. 

AIRFRAME

THE CABIN SUSTAINED SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE.  THE WINDSCREEN, CHIN BUBBLE, INSTRUMENT PANEL, AND ROOF WERE ALL FOUND SEPARATED FROM THE STRUCTURE.  THE AFT FUSELAGE WAS MOSTLY INTACT WITH THE TRANSMISSION STILL ATTACHED. THE TAILBOOM HAD SEPARATED FROM THE AFT FUSELAGE AT ITS ATTACHMENT POINTS; THE SKIN ALONG THE SIDES OF THE TAILBOOM HAD A ""WAVE"" LIKE APPEARANCE. THE TAILBOOM ATTACHMENT POINTS WERE REMOVED FROM THE AIRFRAME FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION. 

CONTROL CONTINUITY WAS ESTABLISHED THROUGHOUT THE AIRFRAME WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SEGMENT OF THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT THAT EXTENDED FROM THE TRANSMISSION, WHICH WAS NOT LOCATED. 

THE MAIN ROTOR SHAFT WAS FRACTURE SEPARATED JUST BELOW THE MAIN ROTOR HEAD.  THE FRACTURE SURFACE WAS INDICATIVE OF OVERLOAD.  AT THE FRACTURE POINT, THE MAIN ROTOR SHAFT WAS OBLONG WITH IMPACT DAMAGE ON TWO OPPOSING SIDES.  DAMAGE WAS ALSO NOTED ON THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE HUB, INDICATIVE OF A MAST BUMP EVENT.   

ENGINE

THE ENGINE WAS FOUND SEPARATED FROM THE HELICOPTER. THE EXHAUST AND AIRFRAME INLET WERE REMOVED. ORGANIC DEBRIS WAS NOTED IN THE ENGINE INLET, AND METAL SPRAY WAS FOUND ON THE SECOND STAGE POWER TURBINE NOZZLE VANES. TEAR AND BATTER DAMAGE WAS NOTED TO THE FIRST STAGE AXIAL COMPRESSOR BLADES AND THE INLET GUIDE VANES. ROTATION OF THE POWER TURBINE PRODUCED CORRESPONDING ROTATION TO THE ENGINE OUTPUT SHAFT AND OVERSPEED GOVERNOR DRIVE GEARBOX; THE ENGINE ROTATED SMOOTHLY. THE CHIP DETECTOR WAS EXAMINED AND NO DEBRIS WAS NOTED.  

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

THE TAILBOOM ATTACHMENT POINTS WERE REMOVED FROM THE AIRFRAME AND SENT TO THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD LABORATORY FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION. 

THE MATERIAL RESEARCH ENGINEER REPORTED THAT THE FRACTURE SURFACES OF THE TOP RIGHT AND LEFT ATTACHMENT POINT FITTINGS EXHIBITED RELATIVELY FLAT MORPHOLOGIES, WITH NO INDICATIONS OF LOCAL MATERIAL DEFORMATION OR OUT OF PLANE FRACTURE. CONVERSELY, THE TWO BOTTOM FITTINGS EXHIBITED DARKER AND ROUGH TORTUOUS FRACTURE SURFACES, CONSISTENT WITH OVERSTRESS FAILURE. 

RIGHT TOP FITTING

BOTH MATING SURFACES OF THE RIGHT TOP FITTING WERE EXAMINED AND CRACK ARREST MARKS, INDICATIVE OF PROGRESSIVE CRACK GROWTH, WAS EVIDENT OVER ALMOST THE ENTIRE FRACTURE SURFACE. THE DIRECTION OF THESE ARREST MARKS INDICATED THE CRACKS INITIATED NEAR AND EMANATED FROM A RIVET HOLE WITHIN THE FITTING.  THE LARGER CRACK GREW THROUGH ALMOST THE ENTIRE FITTING CROSS SECTION; THE SMALLER CRACK PROGRESSED TOWARD THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  

THE FITTING AFT FRACTURE SURFACE WAS FURTHER ANALYZED AND THE FRACTURE SURFACE EXHIBITED STRIATIONS, WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH FATIGUE FAILURE. THE AREA AROUND THE RIVET HOLE POSSESSED TWO FATIGUE CRACK INITIATE SITES. THE LARGER CRACK INITIATE SITE WAS ON THE OUTSIDE SURFACE OF THE FITTING, AND THE SMALLER CRACK INITIATE SITE OCCURRED AT A CORNER ADJACENT TO THE RIVET HOLES. 

LEFT TOP FITTING

THE AFT FRACTURE SURFACE WAS RELATIVELY FLAT, ORIENTATED APPROXIMATELY PERPENDICULAR TO THE LENGTH OF THE FITTING. AFTER CLEANING THE FRACTURE SURFACE, CRACK ARREST MARKS WERE OBSERVED OVER MOST OF THE FRACTURE SURFACE. THE FRACTURE SURFACE CONSISTED OF TWO PROGRESSIVE CRACKS THAT INITIATED ON THE CONCAVE SURFACE AND GREW IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, WITH FATIGUE STRIATIONS THROUGHOUT.  THE CRACKS GREW THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THE FITTING CROSS-SECTION, THE REMAINING 15% SUCCUMBED TO OVERSTRESS.  

BOTTOM FITTINGS

THE FRACTURE SURFACES OF THE BOTTOM FITTINGS EXHIBITED FEATURES CONSISTENT WITH OVERSTRESS FAILURE. THE FRACTURE SURFACES DISPLAYED A DULL LUSTER AND TORTUOUS SURFACE APPEARANCE. NEITHER OF THE BOTTOM FITTINGS EXHIBITED INDICATIONS OF FATIGUE AND/OR OTHER FAILURE MODES.","WITNESSES REPORTED THAT, WHEN THE HELICOPTER WAS JUST ABOVE THE TREES DURING AN EXTERNAL LOAD LOGGING OPERATION, THEY EITHER OBSERVED OR HEARD THE LOAD OF LOGS RELEASE EARLY AND IMPACT THE GROUND HARD. WITNESSES THEN OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER’S TAILBOOM SEPARATE FROM THE FUSELAGE AND DESCEND THROUGH THE TREES. THE FUSELAGE IMPACTED THE GROUND INVERTED, AND THE TAILBOOM CAME TO REST ABOUT 140 FT AWAY. A MECHANIC REPORTED THAT THE PILOT HAD INDICATED BEFORE THE FLIGHT THAT THE HELICOPTER FELT LIKE IT “SHUFFLED” DURING TRANSLATIONAL LIFT; HOWEVER, THE MECHANIC SUSPECTED THAT THE TRANSMISSION MOUNTS WERE STARTING TO WEAR AND WOULD NEED TO BE CHANGED AT A LATER DATE. 

POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE AIRFRAME AND ENGINE REVEALED CONTROL CONTINUITY THROUGHOUT THE AIRFRAME EXCEPT FOR A PORTION OF THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT THAT EXTENDED FROM THE TRANSMISSION, WHICH WAS NOT FOUND. THE TAILBOOM HAD SEPARATED FROM THE AFT FUSELAGE AT THE TAILBOOM ATTACHMENT POINTS. THE LOWER TWO TAILBOOM ATTACHMENT FITTINGS EXHIBITED FEATURES CONSISTENT WITH OVERSTRESS FAILURE AND DID NOT SHOW INDICATIONS OF FATIGUE AND/OR OTHER FAILURE MODES. THE UPPER TWO TAILBOOM ATTACHMENT FITTINGS BOTH CONTAINED FATIGUE CRACKS THROUGHOUT ALMOST THE ENTIRE FRACTURE SURFACE. 

THE PILOT PURCHASED THE HELICOPTER ABOUT 3 YEARS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT; THAT SAME YEAR, THE HELICOPTER WAS ISSUED A NEW AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATE. ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, THE PREVIOUS OWNER HAD RELINQUISHED THE HELICOPTER’S AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATE TO AVOID PUNITIVE ACTION FOR POOR MAINTENANCE OF THE HELICOPTER. MAINTENANCE RECORDS LOCATED WITHIN THE HELICOPTER DID NOT CONTAIN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO DETERMINE WHEN THE MOST RECENT MAINTENANCE WAS PERFORMED; HOWEVER, THE DOCUMENTS DID REVEAL THAT SEVERAL COMPONENT INSPECTIONS WERE NOT COMPLETED WITHIN THE MANUFACTURER’S RECOMMENDED TIME. IT IS LIKELY THAT LONG-TERM, INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE OF THE HELICOPTER CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE AND SEPARATION OF THE TAILBOOM.","THE FATIGUE FAILURE OF THE UPPER TWO TAILBOOM ATTACHMENT POINTS, WHICH RESULTED IN THE TAILBOOM SEPARATING FROM THE FUSELAGE DURING LOGGING OPERATIONS. CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS POOR MAINTENANCE THROUGHOUT THE HELICOPTER’S OPERATIONAL LIFE."

ON SEPTEMBER 21, 2013, ABOUT 1150 MOUNTAIN STANDARD TIME, A BELL UH-1V HELICOPTER, N22490, WAS DESTROYED WHEN IT IMPACTED THE GROUND NEAR CORDES LAKES, ARIZONA, FOLLOWING THE IN-FLIGHT SEPARATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR HUB AND BLADE ASSEMBLY. THE OWNER/PILOT AND THE NON-PILOT RATED PASSENGER WERE FATALLY INJURED. THE PERSONAL FLIGHT WAS CONDUCTED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF TITLE 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS PART 91. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED, AND NO FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE FLIGHT.

THE HELICOPTER WAS BASED AT SCOTTSDALE AIRPORT (SDL), SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA, AND REPORTEDLY DEPARTED SDL THE MORNING OF THE ACCIDENT. ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, THE HELICOPTER LANDED AT SEDONA AIRPORT (SEZ), SEDONA, ARIZONA, THAT MORNING, WHERE A FLY-IN AND AIRCRAFT EXHIBITION EVENT WAS BEING HELD. SEZ WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 75 NAUTICAL MILES (NM) NORTH OF SDL. THE PILOT AND PASSENGER RE-BOARDED THE HELICOPTER ABOUT 2 HOURS LATER, AND DEPARTED SEZ. ON DEPARTURE, THE HELICOPTER FIRST AIR-TAXIED ALONG RUNWAY 3, WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY DOWNWIND, ABOUT 100 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL. IT WAS THEN OBSERVED TO MAKE A COURSE REVERSAL NEAR THE END OF THE RUNWAY, AND FLEW ALONG RUNWAY 21 BEFORE DEPARTING THE AREA. A SHORT TIME LATER, EYEWITNESSES WHO WERE LOCATED ABOUT 30 MILES SOUTH-SOUTHWEST OF SEZ OBSERVED THE AIRBORNE HELICOPTER ""EXPLODE"" NEAR THEM, AND TELEPHONED 911 TO REPORT THE ACCIDENT.

A PARTIAL RADAR TRACK ASSOCIATED WITH THE HELICOPTER INDICATED THAT THE FIRST TARGET WAS ACQUIRED ABOUT 1138, AT AN INDICATED ALTITUDE OF 6,500 FEET. THAT TARGET WAS LOCATED ABOUT 12 MILES FROM SEZ, ON A MAGNETIC BEARING OF 197 DEGREES. THE LAST RADAR TARGET ASSOCIATED WITH THE HELICOPTER WAS RECORDED ABOUT 1150, AT AN INDICATED ALTITUDE OF 5,700 FEET. THAT FINAL TARGET WAS APPROXIMATELY COINCIDENT WITH THE WRECKAGE LOCATION.

THE WRECKAGE WAS DISTRIBUTED FOR A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 1/2 MILE ALONG THE FLIGHT PATH. FAA AND HONEYWELL PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THE ACCIDENT SITE ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE ACCIDENT, AND BEGAN MAPPING THE DEBRIS FIELD. THE FOLLOWING DAY THE NTSB INVESTIGATOR ARRIVED, THE TEAM COMPLETED THE ON-SCENE MAPPING AND EXAMINATION, AND THE WRECKAGE WAS RECOVERED TO A SECURE FACILITY FOR DETAILED EXAMINATION.


PERSONNEL INFORMATION

THE PILOT HELD A PRIVATE PILOT CERTIFICATE WITH AIRPLANE SINGLE- AND MULTI-ENGINE LAND RATINGS, AND WAS ISSUED A ROTORCRAFT HELICOPTER RATING IN MAY 2013. ON HIS MOST RECENT APPLICATION FOR AN FAA MEDICAL CERTIFICATE, THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE HAD 1,856 TOTAL HOURS OF FLIGHT EXPERIENCE. HIS HELICOPTER FLIGHT TRAINING AND FLIGHT EXAMINATION WERE CONDUCTED IN A HUGHES 269 HELICOPTER.

PORTIONS OF THE PILOT'S FLIGHT LOG WERE RECOVERED IN THE WRECKAGE, AND PARTIALLY-COMPLETED HELICOPTER FLIGHT LOGS WERE RECOVERED FROM THE PILOT'S HANGAR. REVIEW OF THE AVAILABLE RECORDS INDICATED THAT THE PILOT HAD PURCHASED THE HELICOPTER IN TEXAS IN APRIL 2013. HE REPORTEDLY RECEIVED 1 TO 2 HOURS OF INSTRUCTION IN THE HELICOPTER WHILE IT WAS IN TEXAS, BUT THIS WAS NOT ABLE TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE INVESTIGATION. THE PILOT THEN FLEW THE HELICOPTER TO HIS HOME BASE IN ARIZONA, IN A TRIP THAT CONSISTED OF 7 LEGS AND 9.6 FLIGHT HOURS. ON THAT TRIP, THE PILOT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A ROTORCRAFT INSTRUCTOR WHO HAD NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE IN THE UH-1 OR ANY OF ITS VARIANTS.

IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE DELIVERY TRIP AND EARLY MAY, 2013, THE PILOT CONDUCTED 5 FLIGHTS IN THE HELICOPTER WITH TWO OTHER, DIFFERENT INSTRUCTORS, ONE OF WHOM WAS HIS FLIGHT EXAMINER FOR HIS ROTORCRAFT RATING. THOSE FLIGHTS HAD A TOTAL DURATION OF 8.3 HOURS. THE RECORDS INDICATED THAT SUBSEQUENT TO THAT, THE PILOT COMPLETED 12 ADDITIONAL FLIGHTS, WITH A TOTAL DURATION OF 13.4 HOURS, IN THE HELICOPTER BUT WITHOUT AN INSTRUCTOR. SEVERAL OF THE FLIGHT ENTRIES DID NOT HAVE DATES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. THE LAST DATED FLIGHT ENTRY IN THE HELICOPTER WAS FOR A FLIGHT ON AUGUST 4, 2013. THAT ENTRY WAS FOLLOWED BY TWO UNDATED ONES FOR TWO MORE FLIGHTS, THE LAST OF WHICH WAS TO PAYSON, ARIZONA. THE LAST ENTRY THAT WAS DATED IN THE PILOT'S FLIGHT LOG WAS FOR A FLIGHT ON AUGUST 15. THE DURATION WAS 1.0 HOURS, BUT THE FLIGHT LOCATION/DESTINATION WAS INDECIPHERABLE.

THE PILOT'S HELICOPTER FLIGHT EXAMINER STATED THAT THE PILOT HAD PURCHASED THE UH-1 PRIOR TO HIS COMPLETION OF HIS HELICOPTER RATING. THE EXAMINER ESTIMATED THAT THE PILOT HAD LESS THAN 100 HOURS OF HELICOPTER FLIGHT EXPERIENCE AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. COMPILATION OF ALL AVAILABLE RECORDS INDICATED THAT THE PILOT HAD A TOTAL FLIGHT EXPERIENCE OF ABOUT 33 HOUR IN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER MAKE AND MODEL.

THE YAVAPAI COUNTY (ARIZONA) OFFICE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER (ME) AUTOPSY REPORT CITED MULTIPLE BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA AS THE CAUSE OF DEATH. THE REPORT CITED A TOXICOLOGY FINDING FOR ETHANOL OF 1.470 MG/G, WHICH IS A WEIGHT PER UNIT WEIGHT PARAMETER. THE LABORATORY THAT CONDUCTED THE TOXICOLOGY DETERMINATION WAS LOCATED IN INDIANA. THE INVESTIGATION WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE HOW THE SAMPLES WERE PACKED, HOW LONG THEY WERE IN TRANSIT, AND UNDER WHAT TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS; WITHOUT SUCH INFORMATION THE POSSIBILITY OF PUTREFACTION, AND RESULTANT ETHANOL PRODUCTION, COULD NOT BE QUANTIFIED. EXCEPT FOR CAFFEINE AND NICOTINE, ALL OTHER YAVAPAI COUNTY ME TOXICOLOGY FINDINGS WERE NEGATIVE.

THE FAA CIVIL AEROMEDICAL INSTITUTE (CAMI) CONDUCTED FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY EXAMINATIONS ON SPECIMENS FROM THE PILOT, AND REPORTED THAT NO CARBON MONOXIDE, CYANIDE, ETHANOL, OR ANY SCREENED DRUGS WERE DETECTED. THE CAMI CUTOFF LEVEL FOR ETHANOL WAS 10 MG/DL, WHICH IS A WEIGHT PER UNIT VOLUME PARAMETER.


AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER WAS MANUFACTURED IN 1974. IT WAS EQUIPPED WITH A LYCOMING/HONEYWELL T-53 SERIES TURBOSHAFT ENGINE, AND WAS ORIGINALLY DELIVERED TO THE UNITED STATES (US) ARMY. THE HELICOPTER WAS EQUIPPED WITH A TWO-BLADE TEETERING MAIN ROTOR (MR) SYSTEM, AND A TWO-BLADE TAIL ROTOR (TR) SYSTEM. FOR REFERENCE AND MAINTENANCE PURPOSES, THE TWO BLADES AND THEIR CONTROL COMPONENTS IN EACH ROTOR SYSTEM WERE DIFFERENTIATED BY ARBITRARILY ASSIGNING THEM COLOR NAMES, IN THIS CASE ""RED"" AND ""WHITE;"" BOTH THE MR AND TR SYSTEMS EACH HAD ONE RED AND ONE WHITE BLADE.

IN 2001, THE HELICOPTER WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE CIVIL REGISTRY AS SURPLUS EQUIPMENT, TO A NON-PROFIT AGENCY IN TEXAS. IN 2004, THE HELICOPTER WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE MARINE AVIATION MUSEUM IN TEXAS, AND WAS SOLD TO JR HELICOPTER IN 2012, WHICH SOLD IT TO THE ACCIDENT PILOT IN APRIL 2013.

ACCORDING TO BELL RECORDS, THE HELICOPTER WAS DELIVERED AS A UH-1H. THE US ARMY CONVERTED IT TO A MEDICAL CONFIGURATION, UH-1V. AT SOME POINT THE HELICOPTER WAS AGAIN MODIFIED, BACK TO A UH-1H CONFIGURATION, BUT THE CIVIL REGISTRY DID NOT REFLECT THAT; IT REMAINED REGISTERED AS A UH-1V. IN MARCH 2013, JR HELICOPTER UNSUCCESSFULLY REQUESTED THAT THE FAA ALTER THE REGISTRATION TO DESIGNATE IT AS A UH-1H MODEL.

ON MAY 6, 2013, THE PILOT SUBMITTED HIS APPLICATION TO THE FAA FOR THE SPECIAL AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATE. THE FAA REGISTERED THE HELICOPTER TO THE PILOT IN THE ""EXPERIMENTAL"" CLASS, ""EXHIBITION"" CATEGORY IN JULY 2013. FAA REPRESENTATIVES AT THE SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA FLIGHT STANDARDS DISTRICT OFFICE (FSDO) REPORTED THAT THE PHASE II LIMITATIONS ISSUED BY THE HOUSTON FSDO ON MARCH 28, 2013, REMAINED IN EFFECT AFTER THE TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP TO THE ACCIDENT PILOT.

REVIEW OF THE MAINTENANCE RECORDS THAT WERE OBTAINED BY THE INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT THAT THE MOST RECENT ANNUAL CONDITION INSPECTION WAS COMPLETED ON APRIL 20, 2013. THAT INSPECTION WAS SIGNED OFF BY THE SELLER OF THE HELICOPTER, AND STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS IN ""A SAFE OPERATIONAL CONDITION FOR CONTINUED USE."" THE RECORDS INDICATED THAT AT THE TIME OF THAT INSPECTION, THE HELICOPTER HAD A TOTAL TIME IN SERVICE OF JUST OVER 3,664 HOURS. THE MOST RECENT AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVE (AD) COMPLIANCE LIST FOR THE HELICOPTER WAS DATED DECEMBER 26, 2006, BUT THAT LIST WAS ANNOTATED TO INDICATE THAT IT WAS RE-VALIDATED ON DECEMBER 22, 2008.

REVIEW OF RECOVERED FLIGHT LOG AND MAINTENANCE RECORDS INDICATED THAT THE HELICOPTER HAD ACCUMULATED APPROXIMATELY 3,693 HOURS TOTAL TIME IN SERVICE AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.


METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

THE SEZ 1135 AUTOMATED WEATHER OBSERVATION INCLUDED WINDS FROM 230 DEGREES AT 5 KNOTS, GUSTING TO 17 KNOTS, VISIBILITY 10 MILES, WITH CLEAR SKIES. REVIEW OF AVAILABLE METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION INDICATED THAT WINDS ALOFT IN THE GENERAL VICINITY OF THE ACCIDENT LOCATION WERE FROM 210 DEGREES AT 15 KNOTS AT 6,000 FEET, AND 220 DEGREES AT 18 KNOTS FOR 7,000 FEET.


WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER DEBRIS TRAIL WAS ORIENTED ALONG A MAGNETIC TRACK OF ABOUT 160 DEGREES. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE NORTHERNMOST (EARLIEST) AND SOUTHERNMOST (LAST) ITEMS IN THE DEBRIS FIELD WAS ABOUT 3,200 FEET. HOWEVER, THE NORTHERNMOST ITEMS WERE LIGHT, LOW-DENSITY, AND HIGH-DRAG ITEMS, WHICH WERE MORE READILY INFLUENCED BY WINDS. THE DISTANCE FROM THE NORTHERNMOST WRECKAGE ITEM NOT READILY INFLUENCED BY THE WIND TO THE SOUTHERN END OF THE DEBRIS FIELD WAS ABOUT 2,000 FEET. THE MAJORITY OF THE DEBRIS WAS ARRAYED IN HIGHLY LINEAR FASHION, BUT THE MAIN ROTOR ASSEMBLY, WHICH INCLUDED THE TWO BLADES AND THE HUB, WAS LOCATED ABOUT 600 FEET EAST OF THE DEBRIS TRAIL.

THE DEBRIS TRAIL INCLUDED THE COCKPIT WINDSHIELDS AND DOORS, CABIN SIDEWALL, AND CABIN INTERIOR ITEMS. THE MAJORITY OF THE HELICOPTER, INCLUDING THE COCKPIT/CABIN, ENGINE, TRANSMISSION, TAIL BOOM, AND TAIL ROTOR ASSEMBLY, WAS LOCATED IN OR NEAR AN IMPACT CRATER AT THE SOUTHERN END OF THE DEBRIS TRAIL. NO EVIDENCE OF ANY PRE-IMPACT FAILURES OF THE ENGINE, REDUCTION GEARBOX, TRANSMISSION, OR TAIL ROTOR DRIVE ASSEMBLIES WAS OBSERVED. NO EVIDENCE OF FIRE OR A HIGH-ORDER EXPLOSION WAS OBSERVED ON ANY COMPONENTS FOUND IN THE DEBRIS TRAIL, AND THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF FIRE WAS OBSERVED IN AND AROUND THE MAIN IMPACT CRATER.

THE INITIAL ON-SCENE AND POST RECOVERY EXAMINATIONS OF THE WRECKAGE RESULTED IN THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS:
-	THE MR HUB AND BLADE ASSEMBLY SEPARATED AS A UNIT FROM THE HELICOPTER
-	THE LOCATION OF THE MR HUB AND BLADE ASSEMBLY, ABOUT 600 FEET EAST OF THE NORTH-SOUTH MAIN DEBRIS TRAIL, WAS CONSISTENT WITH AN EARLY EVENT IN THE ACCIDENT SEQUENCE
-	THE LOCATION OF THE MR HUB AND BLADE ASSEMBLY WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSEMBLY HAVING SUFFICIENT ROTATIONAL ENERGY TO 'FLY' IN A NON-BALLISTIC PATH THAT DIVERGED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE HELICOPTER'S FLIGHT PATH
-	THE DAMAGE PATTERNS TO THE MR HUB AND BLADE ASSEMBLY AND THE REST OF THE HELICOPTER WERE CONSISTENT WITH ONE OR BOTH OF THE MR BLADES CUTTING INTO THE COCKPIT AND CABIN
-	THE DAMAGE PATTERNS WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE RIGHT COCKPIT/CABIN SIDEWALL AND RIGHT LANDING SKID BEING SHEARED FROM THE HELICOPTER IN A PLANE ORIENTED APPROXIMATELY PARALLEL TO THE HELICOPTER'S LONGITUDINAL AND VERTICAL AXES, FROM FRONT TO BACK.
-	FIVE COMPONENTS OF THE MR ""WHITE"" BLADE CONTROL SYSTEM WERE NOT LOCATED; THESE INCLUDED THE PITCH HORN, PITCH CHANGE LINK, STABILIZER BAR MIXING LEVER, ROTARY DAMPER ASSEMBLY, AND THE PITCH CONTROL TUBE NORMALLY SITUATED BETWEEN THE SCISSOR LINKS AND THE STABILIZER BAR ASSEMBLY.
-	THE DAMAGE PATTERNS WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSING WHITE COMPONENTS BEING LIBERATED BY OVERLOAD FORCES WHILE THE MR HUB AND BLADE ASSEMBLY WAS ROTATING

THE MR HUB AND BLADE ASSEMBLY, WITH THE MR BLADE GRIPS AND MOST OF THE MR BLADE LEADING EDGE SPARS ATTACHED, SEPARATED VIA A ROTOR MAST FRACTURE AT THE BASE OF THE HUB. AT THE MAST FRACTURE LOCATION, THE CIRCULAR CROSS SECTION OF THE MAST WAS DEFORMED TO AN OVAL. THE MAST FRACTURE WAS CONSISTENT WITH OVERLOAD, AND NO EVIDENCE OF PRE-EXISTING PROBLEMS SUCH AS CORROSION OR FATIGUE, WAS OBSERVED. ABOVE THE FRACTURE, THE MAST EXHIBITED EVIDENCE OF HARD CONTACT WITH THE ALUMINUM MAIN ROTOR HUB STATIC STOPS. THE STATIC STOPS EXHIBITED CORRESPONDING CONTACT WITNESS MARKS AND DEFORMATION.

THE HUB MOMENT SPRING SUPPORT ASSEMBLY REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MR YOKE, BUT THE HUB SPRINGS (ELASTIC BUMPERS) WERE NOT INSTALLED. THE STABILIZER BAR ASSEMBLY WAS FOUND SEPARATED FROM THE MR HUB AND BLADE ASSEMBLY. THE WHITE SIDE STABILIZER SUPPORT REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE WHITE CENTER FRAME OF THE STABILIZER BAR ASSEMBLY. THE WHITE STABILIZER SUPPORT WAS FRACTURE-SEPARATED FROM THE WHITE SIDE TRUNNION, AND ALL FOUR SUPPORT ATTACH BOLT FRACTURES WERE CONSISTENT WITH SHEAR AND BENDING OVERLOAD FORCES.

THE TAILBOOM WAS FRACTURE-SEPARATED FROM THE FUSELAGE, CONSISTENT WITH OVERLOAD, AND WAS LOCATED ADJACENT TO THE MAIN WRECKAGE. THE TR DRIVE SHAFT AND HOUSING ALONG THE TOP OF THE TAILBOOM DID NOT EXHIBIT ANY NON-IMPACT-RELATED DISTRESS. NO EVIDENCE OF ANY PRE-IMPACT ANOMALIES IN THE TR SYSTEM WAS OBSERVED.

THE ENGINE WAS FOUND IN THE MAIN WRECKAGE CRATER, BUT WAS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE FIRE-AFFECTED AREA; THE ENGINE WAS FOUND SEPARATED FROM THE FUSELAGE MOUNTS. ENGINE DAMAGE SIGNATURES, INCLUDING BLADE DEFORMATION, AND METAL SPATTERING AND ACCRETIONS, WERE CONSISTENT WITH ROTATION UNDER POWER AT THE TIME OF IMPACT. NO EVIDENCE OF ANY PRE-IMPACT ENGINE ANOMALIES WAS OBSERVED.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE INITIAL RECOVERY EFFORTS, TWO ADDITIONAL DEDICATED SEARCH EFFORTS WERE CONDUCTED IN ATTEMPTS TO LOCATE THE MISSING COMPONENTS FROM THE WHITE MR BLADE CONTROL SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH BOTH OF THOSE SEARCHES LOCATED ADDITIONAL DEBRIS, THE NOTED WHITE MR BLADE CONTROL SYSTEM COMPONENTS WERE NEVER LOCATED.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

MAIN ROTOR HUB MOMENT SPRING

IN THE MID 1980'S THE UNITED STATES ARMY, IN CONJUNCTION WITH BELL HELICOPTER, DEVELOPED AND INSTALLED A ""HUB MOMENT SPRING KIT"" ON US ARMY UH-1 HELICOPTERS. ACCORDING TO ARMY MAINTENANCE GUIDANCE DOCUMENT TM-55-1520-210-10, THE HUB MOMENT SPRING ALSO PROVIDED ""AN ADDITIONAL MARGIN OF SAFETY IN THE EVENT OF AN INADVERTENT EXCURSION OF THE HELICOPTER BEYOND THE APPROVED FLIGHT ENVELOPE.""

ON FEBRUARY 1, 2002, THE FAA ISSUED AD 2002-01-31, WHICH AFFECTED MULTIPLE MODELS OF THE BELL UH-1, 204 AND 205 HELICOPTERS ""WITH MAIN ROTOR MAST (MAST), PART NUMBER (P/N) 204-011-450-007... OR MAIN ROTOR TRUNNION (TRUNNION), P/N 204-011-105-001 INSTALLED, CERTIFICATED IN ANY CATEGORY."" REVIEW OF THE MAINTENANCE RECORDS INDICATED THAT BOTH THE MAIN ROTOR MAST AND MAIN ROTOR TRUNNION PART NUMBERS SPECIFIED BY THE AD WERE INSTALLED ON THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER. AMONG OTHER ACTIONS, THE AD REQUIRED, WITHIN 25 HOURS TIME IN SERVICE, THE REMOVAL OF ""ANY HUB SPRING INSTALLED ON ANY AFFECTED HELICOPTER"" WHICH WERE ""INTENDED TO PREVENT FAILURE OF A MAST OR TRUNNION, SEPARATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM, AND SUBSEQUENT LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE HELICOPTER.""

REVIEW OF THE HELICOPTER'S MOST RECENT AD COMPLIANCE LIST INDICATED THAT THE AD HAD BEEN COMPLIED WITH, WHICH WAS CONTRARY TO THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OBSERVED DURING THE WRECKAGE EXAMINATION. THE HUB SPRINGS (ELASTIC BUMPERS) HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE HELICOPTER, BUT THE HUB SPRING SUPPORT MOUNT WAS STILL INSTALLED ON THE HELICOPTER. THE NORMAL STATIC STOPS LIMIT THE HUB TEETER (PIVOT) ANGLE TO A VALUE LESS THAN THAT REQUIRED TO RESULT IN CONTACT BETWEEN THE BUMPER-LESS SPRING MOUNT AND THE MAST.


POST-PURCHASE PILOT MAINTENANCE INQUIRIES

SUBSEQUENT TO HIS RETURN TO ARIZONA WITH THE NEWLY PURCHASED HELICOPTER, THE PILOT CONTACTED SEVERAL PERSONS OR AGENCIES KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT UH-1 HELICOPTERS, WITH THE APPARENT INTENT OF SOLICITING MAINTENANCE ADVICE AND/OR SERVICES.

ON MAY 6, 2013, IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FROM THE PILOT, THE PILOT'S ROTORCRAFT EXAMINER PHYSICALLY EXAMINED THE HELICOPTER IN DETAIL. IN A POST-ACCIDENT INTERVIEW WITH THE NTSB, HE REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS IN ""FAIRLY DECENT SHAPE"" WHEN HE EXAMINED IT. THE EXAMINER NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE DAMPERS WAS IN NEED OF REPAIR/REPLACEMENT, BUT STATED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE FUNCTIONAL. HE DID NOT PROVIDE ANY OBSERVATIONS REGARDING THE VISUAL APPEARANCE OR CLARITY OF THE DAMPER OIL.

ALSO IN EARLY MAY, 2013, AND IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FROM THE PILOT, THE PRESIDENT OF A COMPANY CALLED HELICOPTER CONSULTING (HC) BRIEFLY EXAMINED THE HELICOPTER. HIS FINDINGS WERE SUMMARIZED IN A MAY 7, 2013, LETTER TO THE PILOT. THE LETTER STATED THAT ALTHOUGH THE MAINTENANCE RE","ABOUT 5 MONTHS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, THE PILOT PURCHASED THE FORMER MILITARY HELICOPTER, WHICH HE WAS OPERATING AS AN EXPERIMENTAL AIRCRAFT IN THE EXHIBITION CATEGORY, AND HAD FLOWN IT ABOUT 33 HOURS. ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, DURING CRUISE FLIGHT, ABOUT 2,000 FT ABOVE GROUND LEVEL, THE MAIN ROTOR (MR) MAST FAILED, AND THE MR HUB AND BLADE ASSEMBLY SEPARATED FROM THE HELICOPTER. THE PRIMARY DEBRIS TRAIL WAS RELATIVELY LINEAR AND EXTENDED A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 2,000 FT. EXAMINATION OF THE RECOVERED WRECKAGE REVEALED THAT FIVE COMPONENTS OF ONE MR BLADE’S PITCH CONTROL SYSTEM, INCLUDING A ROTARY DAMPER ASSEMBLY, WERE MISSING. SEVERAL SUBSEQUENT SEARCHES OF THE ACCIDENT SITE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL IN LOCATING THE MISSING COMPONENTS. THE INABILITY TO LOCATE THESE FIVE COMPONENTS, COMBINED WITH THE DAMAGE PATTERNS ON NEIGHBORING COMPONENTS THAT WERE RECOVERED, SUGGESTED THAT THE COMPONENTS’ SEPARATION WAS THE PRECIPITATING EVENT IN THE ACCIDENT SEQUENCE. IT IS LIKELY THAT ONE OR MORE OF THE MISSING COMPONENTS EITHER FAILED OR OTHERWISE BECAME DETACHED, WHICH RESULTED IN A LOSS OF MR BLADE PITCH CONTROL, MAST BUMPING, AND MAST FAILURE.FOR MOST OF THE 9 YEARS BEFORE ITS PURCHASE, THE HELICOPTER HAD BEEN ON DISPLAY IN A MUSEUM AND WAS FLOWN INFREQUENTLY. AFTER ACQUIRING THE HELICOPTER, THE PILOT CONTACTED SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO WERE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THIS MAKE AND MODEL HELICOPTER TO SOLICIT MAINTENANCE ADVICE AND/OR SERVICES. INTERVIEWS OF THESE PEOPLE AND REVIEW OF AVAILABLE RECORDS INDICATED THAT THE PILOT, WHO WAS NOT AN FAA-CERTIFICATED AIRCRAFT MECHANIC, CONDUCTED A MAJORITY OF THE MAINTENANCE ACTIVITY ON THE HELICOPTER. THE PILOT PURCHASED MULTIPLE USED COMPONENTS OF UNKNOWN AIRWORTHINESS AND AT LEAST ONE OF THESE COMPONENTS, A ROTARY DAMPER ASSEMBLY, WAS INSTALLED ON THE MR BLADE PITCH CONTROL SYSTEM BY THE PILOT ABOUT 2 MONTHS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. HOWEVER, INCOMPLETE COMPONENT PURCHASE AND AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE RECORDS PREVENTED THE INVESTIGATION FROM DETERMINING WHETHER THAT DAMPER WAS STILL INSTALLED ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT AND EXACTLY WHAT MAINTENANCE THE PILOT HAD PERFORMED ON THE MR BLADE PITCH CONTROL SYSTEM.THE PILOT’S LIMITED MAINTENANCE QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE DECREASED THE LIKELIHOOD THAT HE WOULD DETECT NONAIRWORTHY CONDITIONS OR COMPONENTS AND INCREASED THE RISK OF IMPROPER REPAIRS. IT IS LIKELY THAT THE INFLIGHT SEPARATION OF THE MR HUB AND BLADE ASSEMBLY WAS PRECIPITATED BY THE PILOT’S IMPROPER MAINTENANCE ACTIONS ON THE MR BLADE PITCH CONTROL SYSTEM.","THE PILOT'S IMPROPER MAINTENANCE ON THE HELICOPTER’S MAIN ROTOR BLADE PITCH CONTROL SYSTEM, WHICH RESULTED IN AN IN-FLIGHT LOSS OF MAIN ROTOR BLADE PITCH CONTROL, MAST BUMPING, AND MAST FAILURE."

ON DECEMBER 2, 2014, ABOUT 1400 MOUNTAIN STANDARD TIME, A ROBINSON R44 II HELICOPTER, N3234U, IMPACTED A TWO-STORY BUILDING WHILE MANEUVERING NEAR SKYPARK AIRPORT (BTF), BOUNTIFUL, UTAH. THE COMMERCIAL PILOT/MECHANIC AND PASSENGER WERE FATALLY INJURED, AND THE HELICOPTER WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED. THE HELICOPTER WAS REGISTERED TO NATIVE RANGE CAPTURE SERVICES, INC., ELKO, NEVADA, AND OPERATED BY NATIVE RANGE, INC, VENTURA, CALIFORNIA. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED FOR THE AREA, AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE LOCAL,  POST-MAINTENANCE TEST FLIGHT, WHICH WAS CONDUCTED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS PART 91. THE FLIGHT DEPARTED FROM BTF SHORTLY BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.

ACCORDING TO THE OWNER OF THE HELICOPTER, THE PILOT/MECHANIC WAS PERFORMING MAINTENANCE ON THE MAIN ROTOR ASSEMBLY AND THE PURPOSE OF THE POST-MAINTENANCE FLIGHT WAS PART OF THE PROCEDURE TO ""TRACK AND BALANCE"" THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES. THIS MAINTENANCE SPANNED OVER SEVERAL DAYS.

SEVERAL WITNESSES IN THE AREA OF THE ACCIDENT SITE HEARD ""POPPING"" OR ""BANGING"" SOUNDS THEN SAW THE MAIN ROTOR AND EMPENNAGE SEPARATE FROM THE HELICOPTER. SOME OF THE WITNESSES THEN SAW THE HELICOPTER TUMBLE IN FLIGHT AND IMPACT THE TOP OF A BUILDING. THE MAIN ROTOR AND EMPENNAGE CAME TO REST ON THE GROUND A FEW HUNDRED FEET FROM THE IMPACTED BUILDING. SECURITY CAMERA VIDEO FOOTAGE FROM A NEARBY BUSINESS CAPTURED THE HELICOPTER IN THE AIR SHORTLY AFTER THE SEPARATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR AND EMPENNAGE.

PERSONNEL INFORMATION

THE PILOT, AGE 65, HELD A COMMERCIAL PILOT CERTIFICATE WITH ROTORCRAFT, AIRPLANE SINGLE-ENGINE LAND, MULTI-ENGINE LAND, AND INSTRUMENT RATINGS. THE PILOT HELD A  FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) SECOND-CLASS MEDICAL CERTIFICATE, WHICH WAS ISSUED ON APRIL 1, 2014, WITH NO LIMITATIONS. THE PILOT REPORTED ON HIS MOST RECENT MEDICAL CERTIFICATE APPLICATION THAT HE HAD ACCUMULATED 5,500 TOTAL HOURS OF FLIGHT EXPERIENCE. THE PILOT WAS ISSUED A MECHANIC CERTIFICATE ON AUGUST 17, 2012, WITH RATINGS FOR AIRFRAME AND POWERPLANT. HE ATTENDED THE ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY'S MAINTENANCE COURSE IN DECEMBER 2008.

THE PASSENGER, AGE 63, HELD A PRIVATE PILOT CERTIFICATE WITH A RATING FOR AIRPLANE SINGLE-ENGINE LAND. HE HELD AN FAA THIRD-CLASS MEDICAL CERTIFICATE, ISSUED ON OCTOBER 26, 2006, WITH THE LIMITATIONS THAT HE MUST HAVE AVAILABLE GLASSES FOR NEAR VISION, AND NOT VALID FOR ANY CLASS AFTER. THE PILOT REPORTED ON HIS MOST RECENT MEDICAL CERTIFICATE APPLICATION THAT HE HAD ACCUMULATED 250 TOTAL HOURS OF FLIGHT EXPERIENCE. HE WAS ISSUED A MECHANIC CERTIFICATE ON SEPTEMBER 9, 2008, WITH RATINGS FOR AIRFRAME AND POWERPLANT. HE HAD NOT ATTENDED THE ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY'S MAINTENANCE COURSE.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

THE FOUR-SEAT HELICOPTER WAS MANUFACTURED IN FEBRUARY 2007. IT WAS POWERED BY A LYCOMING IO-540-AE1A5 RECIPROCATING ENGINE RATED AT 205 HORSEPOWER.

THE HELICOPTER'S OWNER STATED THAT, DURING A FLIGHT IN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER THE MONTH BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, THE HELICOPTER ""HAD A BIT OF A VERTICAL [VERTICAL VIBRATIONS]"". THE BLADES ALSO HAD NOTICEABLE SLOP AND MOVEMENT IN THE PITCH CHANGE LINK BOLT ATTACHMENT TO THE SWASHPLATE. DURING A 100-HOUR INSPECTION, ON NOVEMBER 2, 2014, AT 582 HOURS OF HELICOPTER TOTAL TIME, THE OWNER AND PILOT/MECHANIC RECOMMENDED SENDING THE BLADES OUT FOR REWORK. ACCORDING TO AIRFRAME RECORDS, THE [RED] MAIN ROTOR BLADE PITCH HORN WAS REPLACED, AND THE PILOT-RATED MECHANIC DECLINED REPAINTING OF THE BLADES. WHEN THE BLADES RETURNED, THE OWNER HIRED THE PILOT-RATED MECHANIC TO INSTALL THE BLADES AND TRACK THEM IN A HEAVIER CONFIGURATION.

ACCORDING TO A MECHANIC WHO SPOKE WITH THE PILOT A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, THEY DISCUSSED AN ELONGATED PITCH CHANGE LINK ATTACHMENT HOLE ON THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER AND HOW TO ADDRESS IT. ON THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT, THEY SPOKE AGAIN, AND THE PILOT SAID HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE TRACKING THE BLADES ON THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER. HE REPORTED THAT THE BLADES COULD NOT TRACK ANY BETTER THAN A 1/2-INCH SEPARATION, AND THAT HE WAS USING THE TRIM TABS TO CHANGE THE TRACK. THE MECHANIC SUGGESTED THAT THE PILOT USE THE FINE ADJUSTMENTS ON THE PITCH CHANGE LINKS, THEN FLY THROUGH ALL FLIGHT REGIMES, AND FINE TUNE WITH THE TRIM TABS. HE RECOMMENDED TO THE PILOT TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRE ROTOR SYSTEM AND THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS.

REVIEW OF THE HELICOPTER'S MAINTENANCE RECORDS SHOWED THAT ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2007, AT 87.3 HOURS  TOTAL TIME, THE HUB AND BLADES WERE REBUILT BY ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY. THE SPINDLES, WHICH INCLUDE THE PITCH HORNS, WERE REUSED DURING THE REBUILD.

A DETAILED REPORT OF A FOLLOW-UP EXAMINATION IS CONTAINED IN THE NTSB PUBLIC DOCKET.

MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

POSTMORTEM EXAMINATIONS WERE PERFORMED ON THE PILOT AND PASSENGER BY THE UTAH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE. THE CAUSE OF DEATH FOR EACH WAS REPORTED AS TOTAL BODY BLUNT FORCE INJURIES.

THE FAA'S CIVIL AEROSPACE MEDICAL INSTITUTE PERFORMED FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY ON SPECIMENS FROM THE PILOT. THE TESTS WERE NEGATIVE FOR CARBON MONOXIDE, CYANIDE, VOLATILES AND TESTED-FOR DRUGS.

TEST AND RESEARCH

THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES (BOTH INBOARD SECTIONS), HUB, UPPER MAST SECTION, UPPER DRIVE SHAFT SECTION, DROOP STOPS (2), YOKE, PITCH CHANGE LINKS (2), MAIN ROTOR BLADE PITCH CHANGE HORNS (2), AND SWASHPLATE WERE SENT TO THE NTSB MATERIALS LABORATORY FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION. THE EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT ALL FRACTURES WERE CONSISTED WITH OVERSTRESS FAILURE, AND NO PREEXISTING CRACKING WAS NOTED. THE EXAMINATION ALSO REVEALED THAT THE PITCH CHANGE LINK ATTACHMENT HOLE FOR THE RED BLADE APPEARED INTACT AND FREE OF DAMAGE. THE RED BLADE PITCH LINK WAS INTACT AND RELATIVELY STRAIGHT. THE COUNTERWEIGHTS AND THE LOWER RED BLADE PITCH CHANGE LINK ATTACHMENT HARDWARE WERE MISSING. TORQUE MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN ON NUTS INSTALLED ON THE THREE RECOVERED PITCH CHANGE LINK ATTACHMENT BOLTS. THE TORQUE VALUES FOR ALL THREE NUTS WERE LOWER THAN THAT REQUIRED BY THE MANUFACTURER'S MAINTENANCE MANUAL. A DETAILED REPORT OF THE EXAMINATION IS CONTAINED IN THE NTSB PUBLIC DOCKET.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ACCORDING TO MANUFACTURER'S MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS, THE ATTACHMENT BOLTS USED AT THE UPPER AND LOWER ENDS OF THE PITCH CHANGE LINKS ARE NAS6605 SERIES BOLTS. THE LOCKNUTS FOR THE NAS6605 SERIES BOLTS SHOULD BE FASTENED TO A DRY TORQUE VALUE OF 240 LB-IN","BEFORE THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT, THE COMMERCIAL HELICOPTER PILOT, WHO WAS ALSO A MECHANIC, HAD RE-INSTALLED THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES, WHICH HAD JUST BEEN REWORKED, ON THE HELICOPTER. THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT WAS A TEST FLIGHT TO ADJUST THE TRACK AND BALANCE OF THE ROTOR BLADES. A MECHANIC, WHO SPOKE WITH THE PILOT A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, STATED THAT THEY HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT AN ELONGATED PITCH CHANGE LINK ATTACHMENT HOLE ON THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER AND HOW TO ADDRESS IT. ON THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT, THEY SPOKE AGAIN; THE PILOT WAS HAVING TROUBLE TRACKING THE BLADES ON THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER.  THE PILOT STATED THAT HE COULD NOT GET THE BLADES TO TRACK ANY BETTER, AND THAT HE WAS TRYING TO CHANGE THE TRACK WITH THE TRIM TABS.

WITNESSES IN THE AREA OF THE ACCIDENT SITE HEARD ""POPPING"" OR ""BANGING"" SOUNDS, THEN SAW THE MAIN ROTOR AND EMPENNAGE SEPARATE FROM THE HELICOPTER. SEVERAL OF THE WITNESSES THEN SAW THE HELICOPTER TUMBLE IN FLIGHT AND IMPACT THE ROOF OF A BUILDING. THE MAIN ROTOR AND EMPENNAGE CAME TO REST ON THE GROUND A FEW HUNDRED FEET FROM THE BUILDING. WITNESS STATEMENTS AND WRECKAGE DOCUMENTATION WERE CONSISTENT WITH A MAIN ROTOR BLADE STRIKING THE TAIL AND SUBSEQUENTLY, A MAST BUMP, WHICH RESULTED IN THE HELICOPTER DESCENDING UNCONTROLLABLY.

THE DAMAGE OBSERVED ON THE COMPONENTS OF THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM WAS CONSISTENT WITH AN IN-FLIGHT SEPARATION OF THE PITCH CHANGE LINK FOR THE RED BLADE, WITH SEPARATION OCCURRING AT THE LOCATION WHERE THE PITCH CHANGE LINK ATTACHED TO THE SWASHPLATE. THE SWASHPLATE WAS FREE OF CONTACT MARKS CORRESPONDING TO CONTACT WITH THE RED PITCH CHANGE LINK, WHICH CONTRASTED WITH THE AREA AROUND THE BLUE BLADE PITCH CHANGE LINK ATTACHMENT, WHERE MULTIPLE CONTACT MARKS CORRESPONDING TO CONTACT WITH THE BLUE PITCH CHANGE LINK WERE OBSERVED. ALSO, THE RED PITCH CHANGE LINK WAS INTACT AND RELATIVELY STRAIGHT, INDICATING THAT SEPARATION OCCURRED UNDER LOADS LESS THAN THAT REQUIRED TO BUCKLE OR FRACTURE THE PITCH CHANGE LINK. THE SLIGHT BENDING IN THE RED PITCH CHANGE LINKS WAS LIKELY SECONDARY TO THE SEPARATION OF THE ATTACHMENT AT THE LOWER END AS EVIDENCED BY THE LOCATION OF THE CORRESPONDING THREAD CONTACT MARKS ON THE PITCH HORN. FINALLY, A SERIES OF IMPRESSIONS CORRESPONDING TO CONTACT WITH THREADS ON THE RED BLADE PITCH CHANGE LINK ATTACHMENT BOLT WERE OBSERVED ON THE ATTACHMENT HOLE BORE THROUGH THE SWASHPLATE IN AN AREA THAT SHOULD HAVE ONLY CONTACTED THE GRIP PORTION OF THE BOLT. THUS, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE INTACT BOLT SEPARATED FROM THE ATTACHMENT DUE TO LOSS OF THE LOCK NUT AND PALNUT.

TORQUE MEASUREMENTS WERE OBTAINED ON THE LOCKNUTS INSTALLED ON THE THREE RECOVERED PITCH CHANGE LINK ATTACHMENT BOLTS. ALL MEASURED TORQUE VALUES WERE LOWER THAN THAT SPECIFIED IN THE HELICOPTER'S MAINTENANCE MANUAL, INDICATING THAT THE FASTENERS WERE IMPROPERLY TORQUED BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. WHILE TORQUE FOR THE MISSING ATTACHMENT BOLT COULD NOT BE MEASURED, THE TORQUE MEASURED ON THE REMAINING PITCH CHANGE LINK ATTACHMENT BOLTS AND WITNESS MARKS ON THE ATTACHMENT HOLE BORE IN THE SWASHPLATE SUGGEST THAT THE BOLT LIKELY SEPARATED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT TORQUE APPLIED AT THE TIME OF INSTALLATION, WHICH LED TO THE LOSS OF THE LOCKNUT AND PALNUT DUE TO VIBRATIONAL LOADS UNDER NORMAL OPERATION.","THE PILOT/MECHANIC'S FAILURE TO PROPERLY SECURE THE PITCH LINK HARDWARE OF ONE MAIN ROTOR BLADE TO THE ROTATING SWASH PLATE, WHICH RESULTED IN THE PITCH LINK SEPARATING IN FLIGHT AND A SUBSEQUENT LOSS OF CONTROL."

ON FEBRUARY 18, 2016, ABOUT 1020 HAWAII-ALEUTIAN STANDARD TIME, A BELL 206BIII, N80918, WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED WHEN IT IMPACTED WATER DURING A FORCED LANDING NEAR HONOLULU, HAWAII. THE COMMERCIAL PILOT AND TWO PASSENGERS SUSTAINED SERIOUS INJURIES, ONE PASSENGER SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES, AND ONE PASSENGER WAS FATALLY INJURED. THE HELICOPTER WAS PRIVATELY OWNED AND OPERATED BY GENESIS HELICOPTERS AS A COMMERCIAL AIR TOUR FLIGHT UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF TITLE 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS (CFR) PART 91. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AND A COMPANY FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE LOCAL FLIGHT, WHICH ORIGINATED FROM HONOLULU INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (HNL) ABOUT 0935.

THE PILOT REPORTED THAT, AFTER ARRIVING AT WORK THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, THE HELICOPTER WAS PULLED OUT OF THE HANGAR AND THAT HE BEGAN HIS PREFLIGHT WITH THE COMPANY'S MECHANIC'S ASSISTANT. THE PILOT STATED THAT THEY COMPLETED ""A PRETTY GOOD PREFLIGHT,"" BECAUSE THE FLIGHT WAS THE FIRST TOUR FLIGHT SINCE REPLACEMENT OF THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT. THE PILOT FURTHER STATED THAT HE CONFIRMED FUEL QUANTITY AND CHECKED OTHER FLUIDS BEFORE HE RETRIEVED AND INSPECTED THE LIFE PRESERVERS. THE PILOT THEN WENT UPSTAIRS TO THE COMPANY'S OFFICE, MET THE PASSENGERS, SHOWED THEM THE SAFETY VIDEO, AND STORED THEIR BELONGINGS.

AFTER HE BOARDED THE PASSENGERS, WHOSE SEAT POSITIONS WERE DETERMINED BY WEIGHT AND BALANCE CALCULATIONS, HE PUT THE PASSENGER'S LIFE PRESERVERS ON THEM AND SECURED THEIR SEATBELTS, THE PILOT CONDUCTED A FINAL WALKAROUND OF THE HELICOPTER BEFORE BOARDING AND STARTING THE ENGINE.  AFTER DEPARTURE, THE FLIGHT PROCEEDED TO FLY THE SHORELINE 6 DEPARTURE PROCEDURE TO CROSSOVER TO THE EAST SIDE OF OAHU ISLAND. THE PILOT THEN FLEW ALONG THE SHORELINE BEFORE FLYING TOWARD SACRED VALLEY, THEN NORTH SHORE BEFORE TURNING SOUTH TO FLY DOWN CENTRAL VALLEY, OVER WHEELER ARMY AIRFIELD, AND ON TO PEARL HARBOR.  THE PILOT SAID THAT, AS HE BEGAN THE APPROACH TO FORD ISLAND, HE NOTICED A VIBRATION THROUGHOUT THE CABIN OF THE HELICOPTER THAT SEEMED ""DIFFERENT.""  HE DECIDED TO RETURN DIRECTLY TO HNL; HOWEVER, THE VIBRATION STOPPED, AND HE MADE A LEFT TURN SO THE PASSENGERS COULD SEE THE USS ARIZONA MEMORIAL.

SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE VIBRATION RETURNED, AND THE PILOT CALLED THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER AT HNL TO ADVISE THAT THE FLIGHT WOULD BE RETURNING TO THE AIRPORT. THE CONTROLLER INSTRUCTED THE PILOT TO FLY TO THE PRISON AND HOLD FOR OTHER INBOUND HELICOPTERS. THE PILOT STATED THAT, AT THIS POINT, THE VIBRATION DEVELOPED INTO A GRINDING SENSATION. THEN THE MAIN ROTOR LOW RPM WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED, AND ENGINE RPM BEGAN TO RISE; THE POINT WHERE THE ENGINE AND ROTOR RPM NEEDLES WERE NO LONGER MATCHED ON THE POWER TURBINE GAUGE. THE PILOT THEN LOWERED THE COLLECTIVE, REDUCED THE THROTTLE AND REALIZED THE ENGINE AND MAIN ROTOR WERE NO LONGER CONNECTED AS HE BEGAN TO LOOK FOR A PLACE TO LAND; HE SELECTED THE GRASSY AREA AT THE PEARL HARBOR MEMORIAL VISITOR'S CENTER. DUE TO HIS ALTITUDE, HE SAID HE TRIED TO INCREASE HIS SINK RATE TO MAKE THE SELECTED LANDING AREA AND PUT THE HELICOPTER ""BACK IN TRIM TO LAND"" BEFORE HE NOTICED PEOPLE DISEMBARKING FROM THE USS ARIZONA MEMORIAL FERRY VESSEL IN HIS SELECTED LANDING AREA. TO AVOID THE PEOPLE, THE PILOT TURNED THE HELICOPTER SLIGHTLY LEFT TO LAND IN THE WATER AS CLOSE TO SHORE AS POSSIBLE, WITH HOPES THAT PEOPLE WOULD COME OUT TO HELP. HE STATED THAT WHEN THE HELICOPTER WAS ABOUT 20 FT ABOVE THE WATER, IT FELT LIKE THE ROTOR STALLED, THE HELICOPTER LOST LIFT, AND IT ""FELL OUT OF THE SKY."" THE HELICOPTER DESCENDED RAPIDLY INTO THE WATER ABOUT 20 FT FROM THE SHORELINE.

WITNESSES LOCATED AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS AT THE WORLD WAR II (WWII) VALOR IN THE PACIFIC NATIONAL MONUMENT REPORTED SEEING THE HELICOPTER AT A LOW ALTITUDE BEFORE IT SUDDENLY DESCENDED INTO THE WATER.

A REVIEW OF VIDEO CAPTURED BY A WITNESS REVEALED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS APPROACHING THE CONTEMPLATION CIRCLE AREA OF THE WORLD WAR II VALOR IN THE PACIFIC NATIONAL MONUMENT. THE HELICOPTER'S FORWARD AIRSPEED APPEARED TO DECREASE, THE NOSE PITCHED UP, AND THE HELICOPTER BEGAN TO ROTATE TO THE LEFT IN A SLIGHTLY NOSE-UP ATTITUDE THEN DESCENDED RAPIDLY INTO THE WATER. AT THE TIME OF IMPACT, THE HELICOPTER APPEARED TO BE IN A SLIGHTLY NOSE-HIGH, LEFT BANK ATTITUDE.

PERSONNEL INFORMATION

THE PILOT HELD A COMMERCIAL PILOT CERTIFICATE WITH ROTORCRAFT-HELICOPTER AND INSTRUMENT HELICOPTER RATINGS. IN ADDITION, THE PILOT HELD A FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR CERTIFICATE WITH A ROTORCRAFT-HELICOPTER RATING. THE PILOT HELD A FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION SECOND-CLASS MEDICAL CERTIFICATE ISSUED ON NOVEMBER 6, 2015, WITH NO LIMITATIONS. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE HIS LOGBOOK AFTER HE WAS RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL; HE ESTIMATED THAT AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, HE HAD ACCUMULATED ABOUT 900 TOTAL HOURS OF FLIGHT EXPERIENCE, WITH 151 HOURS IN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER MAKE/MODEL AND 125 HOURS WITHIN THE PREVIOUS 90 DAYS.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WAS A BELL HELICOPTER MODEL 206, SERIAL NUMBER 2687. THE HELICOPTER WAS POWERED BY A ROLLS-ROYCE ALLISON MODEL 250-C20B TURBOSHAFT ENGINE, SERIAL NUMBER CAE-832146, WITH MAXIMUM TAKEOFF AND MAXIMUM CONTINUOUS POWER RATINGS OF 420 SHAFT HORSEPOWER.  THE HELICOPTER WAS NOT EQUIPPED WITH AN EMERGENCY FLOAT SYSTEM.  



THE HELICOPTER WAS EQUIPPED WITH 5 SEATS, TWO IN THE FRONT, AND 3 IN THE AFT SECTION OF THE CABIN.  THE HELICOPTER IS FLOWN FROM THE FRONT RIGHT SEAT, WITH PASSENGER SEATING IN THE REMAINING SEATS AS REFERENCED IN FIGURE 1.  

ACCORDING TO BELL HELICOPTER TEXTRON (BHT) REPRESENTATIVE, AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE HELICOPTER'S POWER TRAIN SYSTEM IS THE ENGINE-TO-TRANSMISSION DRIVE SHAFT, LOCATED BETWEEN THE TRANSMISSION AND FREEWHEELING DRIVE. THE DRIVE SHAFT (AS INSTALLED) IS COMPRISED OF TWO IDENTICAL COUPLINGS, WHICH ARE LOCATED ON EITHER END OF THE SHAFT. THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS CONSIST OF TWO FLANGES POSITIONED ON THE ENDS OF THE TUBULAR, HOLLOW DRIVE SHAFT. THE ASSEMBLY REQUIRES A RETAINER RING AND PACKING SEAL TO BE POSITIONED AGAINST THE FLANGE. A DRIVE SHAFT COUPLING SEAL IS SITUATED AGAINST THE PACKING SEAL, IMPEDING GREASE FROM EGRESSING THE COUPLING ASSEMBLY.

 

 







THE DRIVE SHAFT CONTAINS A GEAR SPROCKET AFFIXED TO THE SHAFT FLANGE VIA 4 BOLTS (BOLT HEADS POSITIONED ON THE INSIDE OF THE COUPLING). THE DONUT-SHAPED GEAR HAS A HOLLOW AREA IN THE MIDDLE THAT ALIGNS WITH THE HOLLOW TUBE SITUATED BETWEEN THE COUPLINGS; A SLIGHT LIP SURROUNDS THE HOLLOW AREA. THE OUTER COUPLING GEAR SURROUNDS THE DRIVE GEAR WHERE IT IS SPLINED, AND TORQUE IS TRANSMITTED. INSIDE THE COUPLING, THE ASSEMBLY IS EQUIPPED WITH A SHAFT CENTERING SPRING. THE SPRING (ITEM 6 IN FIGURE 2) IS POSITIONED BETWEEN THE LIP AND THE END CAP OF THE COUPLING (GREASE RETAINER PLATE). A RETAINER RING AND PACKING SEAL REST AGAINST THE BACK PLATE.

THE BHT MAINTENANCE MANUAL RECOMMENDS THAT, BEFORE REASSEMBLY, THE ENGINE-TO-TRANSMISSION DRIVE SHAFT COUPLINGS BE HAND-PACKED WITH LUBRICANT (C-015 GREASE) OVER THE TOP OF THE INTERNAL SPLINE TEETH TO A DEPTH OF 0.2-0.3 INCH.

MAINTENANCE INTERVIEWS

OWNER OF GENESIS HELICOPTERS

THE OWNER OF THE COMPANY HELD A COMMERCIAL PILOT CERTIFICATE WITH A ROTORCRAFT RATING AND A MECHANIC CERTIFICATE WITH AIRFRAME AND POWERPLANT RATINGS. HE REPORTED THAT THE ACCIDENT PILOT WAS PRESENT DURING MAINTENANCE OF THE ENGINE-TO-TRANSMISSION DRIVE SHAFT TO OBSERVE AND PASS TOOLS TO THE MECHANICS ASSISTANT. THE OWNER STATED THAT HE WITNESSED THE INITIAL BUILDUP OF THE SHAFT, THEN LEFT THE HANGAR FOR ABOUT AN HOUR TO AN HOUR AND A HALF. WHEN HE RETURNED, THE MECHANICS ASSISTANT HAD ALREADY BEGUN INSTALLING THE SHAFT INTO THE HELICOPTER. THE OWNER RECALLED ASKING SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BOLTS GOING INTO THE SHAFT, TO INCLUDE IF THERE WAS FRICTION ON THE NUTS, TO WHICH THE ASSISTANT RESPONDED THAT THERE WAS.

THE OWNER RECALLED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS GROUNDED ON JANUARY 23 BECAUSE THE RUBBER SEAL (WHICH IS LOCATED AT THE BASE OF THE SHORT SHAFT) HAD COME APART, AND REMNANTS WERE FOUND ON THE (ENGINE) DECK. REPLACEMENT PARTS WERE ORDERED ON JANUARY 25, AND THE HELICOPTER WAS FLYING AGAIN ON JANUARY 28. THE OWNER ESTIMATED THAT THE HELICOPTER HAD FLOWN 31 HOURS FROM THE TIME THE SEALS ON THE SHORT SHAFT WERE REPLACED TO THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.

WHEN THE OWNER WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT THE TIMEFRAME OF THE MAINTENANCE PERFORMED ON THE SHORT SHAFT AND PRESENTED WITH THE HELICOPTER LOGBOOKS, HE RESPONDED THAT HE ""CAN'T FIND THEM IN THE LOGS"" AND THAT IT ""MUST NOT HAVE GOTTEN PUT IN THE LOGBOOKS."" WHEN ASKED WHAT MANUAL WAS UTILIZED TO CONDUCT THE MAINTENANCE ON THE SHORT SHAFT SEAL, THE OWNER STATED THAT THEY USED THE MAINTENANCE MANUAL FROM BELL HELICOPTERS.

WHEN ASKED HOW OFTEN MAINTENANCE LOOKED AT THE HELICOPTER, THE OWNER STATED THAT THERE WAS A DAILY INSPECTION AND HE WAS PERSONALLY ""LAYING EYES ON IT EVERY NIGHT."" AFTER THE LAST FLIGHT OF THE DAY, THE HELICOPTER WOULD BE PARKED OUTSIDE AND LOOKED AT BEFORE BEING PLACED IN THE HANGAR FOR THE NIGHT. HE SAID THE INSPECTION WOULD INCLUDED CHECKING THE SECURITY AND MOUNTING, CHECKING ALL THE FLUIDS, AND VISUALLY INSPECTING THE ROTOR HEAD, LIGHTS AND SEATBELTS. HE WOULD ALSO EXAMINE THE GRIPS, BOLTS, DOUBLERS, AND THE TAIL ROTOR AND GEARBOX SECURITY AND MOUNTING. WHEN ASKED IF HE EVER LOOKED IN THE AREA OF THE ENGINE-TO-TRANSMISSION DRIVE SHAFT, HE STATED THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO, BUT WHEN ASKED IF HE RECALLED DOING IT, HE PAUSED BEFORE STATING, ""I THINK THE LAST TIME THAT I LAID EYES ON THE SHORT SHAFT, TRYING TO THINK BACK, PROBABLY 3 OR 4 DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. THERE WAS A SPAN PRIOR TO [FEBRUARY] 18TH THAT WE HADN'T BEEN FLYING. WE WERE WAITING ON PARTS FOR THE TAIL ROTOR.""

THE OWNER FURTHER REPORTED THAT INSPECTIONS AND AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES (ADS) WERE NOT REVIEWED ON A DAILY BASIS. THE 100-HOUR INSPECTION INFORMATION WOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN THE MANUAL, BUT THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANYTHING LIKE A COUNTDOWN TO AN INSPECTION. HE STATED THAT A STATUS SHEET FOR INSPECTIONS OR AD COMPLIANCE WAS NOT KEPT IN THE HELICOPTER.

WHEN ASKED HOW PILOTS ENSURED COMPLIANCE WITH MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS, HE SAID THEY HAD TO RELY ON MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL TO TELL THEM THAT SOMETHING WAS DUE OR CLOSE TO BEING DUE. HE SAID SOMETIMES THE PILOTS WOULD TAKE INITIATIVE AND SEE IN THE FRONT OF THE BOOK THAT A 100-HOUR INSPECTION HAD BEEN COMPLETED. HE SAID THAT IF THE PILOT SAW SOMETHING UNSAFE OR OBSERVED A MAINTENANCE ISSUE, THEN THEY COULD CANCEL THE TRIP ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT HIS APPROVAL. HE SAID THAT PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO COME WORK FOR HIM KNEW THAT HE WOULD NEVER PUSH THEM TO FLY.

THE OWNER PROVIDED A COMPONENT STATUS SHEET ON FEBRUARY 21, 2016. THERE WERE SEVERAL ITEMS THAT INDICATED NEGATIVE TIME REMAINING BEFORE AN INSPECTION WAS DUE. SEVERAL OF THESE ITEMS WERE ANNOTATED WITH CHECK MARKS; THE OWNER INDICATED THAT THESE INSPECTIONS HAD BEEN COMPLETED, BUT THE SHEET HAD NOT YET BEEN UPDATED. WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE NEGATIVE-TIME ITEMS THAT WERE NOT CHECKED, HE REPLIED THAT THE ENGINE INSTALLED IN THE HELICOPTER AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WAS A LOANER ENGINE AND THAT THE COMPRESSOR AND TURBINE LISTED ON THE COMPONENT SHEET WERE NOT EVEN IN THE AIRCRAFT. THOSE COMPONENTS ""HAD GONE TO THE SHOP TO GET ALL THAT STUFF UP TO DATE.""

WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE INSPECTIONS OF THE MAIN ROTOR MAST ASSEMBLY AND THE TENSION TORSION (TT) STRAPS, WHICH WERE OVERDUE ACCORDING TO THE STATUS SHEET, THE OWNER REPLIED THAT THE TAIL ROTOR BLADE HAD BEEN INSPECTED AND THE TT STRAPS HAD NOT BEEN INSPECTED. HE SAID THE OVERHAUL WAS COMING UP AND THAT THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS OF ORDERING PARTS. HIS INTENTION WAS TO TAKE THE HELICOPTER OUT OF SERVICE FOR MAINTENANCE, WHICH WOULD HAVE INCLUDED THE TT STRAPS. WHEN ASKED IF HE KNEW THEY WERE DUE AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, HE STATED THAT HE KNEW THEY WERE COMING DUE, BUT DID NOT KNOW THAT THE HELICOPTER HAD FLOWN THAT EXTENSIVELY, AND DID NOT KNOW THEY WERE DUE UNTIL HE PRINTED THE STATUS SHEET FOR THE INVESTIGATION.

PILOT

DURING AN IN-PERSON INTERVIEW WITH THE PILOT, HE WAS ASKED TO DESCRIBE THE LAST FEW MAINTENANCE ISSUES EXPERIENCED WITH THE HELICOPTER. THE PILOT RECALLED A VIBRATION WITH THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT, WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED. IN ADDITION, HE RECALLED THE HELICOPTER GOING THROUGH EITHER A 50-HOUR OR 100-HOUR INSPECTION AROUND JANUARY 15, 2016, AT WHICH TIME ALL THE PANELS WERE REMOVED, THE INSIDES WERE SCRUBBED, AND ALL BEARINGS WERE RE-GREASED. HE SAID EVERYTHING THAT HAD A GREASE NOZZLE OR TIP RECEIVED GREASE. HE RECALLED ONE OF THE HANGER BEARINGS ON THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT HAD LOOSENED, WHICH WAS FOUND ON THE 100-HOUR INSPECTION. WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE ENGINE-TO-TRANSMISSION SHAFT, HE RECALLED THE SHORT SHAFT SEAL FAILING AND ITS SUBSEQUENT REPLACEMENT, BUT HE COULD NOT RECALL THE DATE OF THE REPLACEMENT. HE SAID THE RUBBER BOOT FROM THE SHORT SHAFT HAD UNSEATED AND GREASE HAD SLUNG AROUND INSIDE THE PANEL. HE RECALLED THAT THE OWNER CALLED HIM ON A SATURDAY TO INFORM HIM THAT FLYING FOR MONDAY HAD BEEN CANCELLED SO THE BOOT COULD BE REPLACED.

THE PILOT STATED THAT HE WAS PRESENT WHEN THE WORK WAS BEING DONE ON THE SHORT SHAFT SEAL AND THAT THE OWNER OF THE COMPANY WAS TEACHING THE MAINTENANCE ASSISTANT HOW TO PRESS THE SEALS. WHILE THE WORK WAS BEING DONE, THE OWNER WAS QUIZZING THE MAINTENANCE ASSISTANT. HE REMEMBERED THE OWNER AND ASSISTANT REFERRING TO THE MAINTENANCE MANUALS. TOWARD THE END OF JANUARY, HE WATCHED THE OWNER GREASE THE ENGINE-TO-TRANSMISSION DRIVE SHAFT AND SAW THE SPLINES ON THE GEAR WHEN THE WORK WAS BEING ACCOMPLISHED.

MECHANIC'S ASSISTANT

THE MECHANICS ASSISTANT, WHO HAD BEEN EMPLOYED WITH GENESIS HELICOPTERS FOR 8-9 YEARS, DID NOT HOLD A MECHANICS CERTIFICATE WITH AIRFRAME OR POWERPLANT RATINGS.  HE REPORTED THAT THE ""SHORT SHAFT"" HAD BEEN REMOVED DUE TO LEAKING GREASE ON JANUARY 25. ONCE THEY HAD RECEIVED THE NEW PARTS AND THE SHORT SHAFT WAS REMOVED, STRIPPED DOWN, AND CLEANED, THE OWNER OF THE COMPANY INSPECTED EVERYTHING BEFORE REASSEMBLY. THE ASSISTANT STATED THAT, DURING THE REASSEMBLY, ONE HALF OF THE ENGINE-TO-TRANSMISSION DRIVE SHAFT WAS PUT BACK TOGETHER, FOLLOWED BY THE OTHER HALF. ONCE THE WORK WAS COMPLETED, THEY CONDUCTED AN ENGINE RUN-UP, A LEAK CHECK, AND A TEST FLIGHT BEFORE RETURNING THE HELICOPTER TO SERVICE. THE ASSISTANT RECALLED THAT, DURING THE INSTALLATION OF THE SHORT SHAFT, THE ACCIDENT PILOT WAS PRESENT. ALTHOUGH THE OWNER OF THE COMPANY WAS NOT PRESENT THE ENTIRE TIME, HE WAS CHECKING THE PROCESS AND QUIZZED HIM ON THE PARTS AND THE TYPE OF GREASE USED, AND HE WAS PRESENT TO VERIFY THAT THE PROPER AMOUNT OF GREASE WAS USED BEFORE INSTALLING THE SHAFT. THE ASSISTANT FURTHER REPORTED THAT HE HAD RE-USED THE SAME NUTS, BOLTS, AND WASHERS TO REASSEMBLE AND REINSTALLED THE SHORT SHAFT.

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

A REVIEW OF RECORDED DATA FROM THE HNL AUTOMATED WEATHER OBSERVATION STATION, LOCATED ABOUT 3 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, REVEALED THE CONDITIONS AT 0953 INCLUDED WIND FROM 050° AT 12 KNOTS WITH GUSTS TO 18 KNOTS, VISIBILITY 10 STATUTE MILES, FEW CLOUDS AT 3,200 FT, SCATTERED CLOUDS AT 4,100 FT, TEMPERATURE 26°C, DEW POINT 13°C, AND AN ALTIMETER SETTING OF 30.13 INCHES OF MERCURY.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

EXAMINATION OF THE ACCIDENT SITE REVEALED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS SUBMERGED ABOUT 40 FT UNDER WATER ABOUT 20 FT FROM THE SHORELINE. THE HELICOPTER WAS REMOVED FROM THE WATER THE DAY FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RINSED WITH FRESH WATER. THE WRECKAGE WAS MOVED TO A SECURE LOCATION FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION.

EXAMINATION OF THE RECOVERED WRECKAGE REVEALED THAT THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES, MAST, TRANSMISSION, ENGINE, TAILBOOM, TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX, AND TAIL ROTOR","THE COMMERCIAL PILOT OF THE HELICOPTER WAS PERFORMING A LOCAL AIR TOUR AROUND THE ISLAND WITH FOUR PASSENGERS ONBOARD. DURING THE FLIGHT, HE NOTICED A VIBRATION THROUGHOUT THE CABIN. THE PILOT DIVERTED TOWARD THE DESTINATION AIRPORT; HOWEVER, WHEN THE VIBRATION STOPPED SHORTLY THEREAFTER, HE DECIDED TO INITIATE A TURN SO THE PASSENGERS COULD SEE A NEARBY LANDMARK. THE VIBRATION RETURNED SHORTLY THEREAFTER, AND THE PILOT BEGAN TO MANEUVER TOWARD THE DESTINATION AIRPORT A SECOND TIME. THE PILOT STATED THAT THE VIBRATION DEVELOPED INTO A GRINDING SENSATION, WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY ILLUMINATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR LOW RPM WARNING LIGHT AND AN INCREASE IN ENGINE RPM TO THE POINT WHERE THE ENGINE AND ROTOR RPM NEEDLES WERE NO LONGER MATCHED ON THE POWER TURBINE GAUGE.  THE PILOT INITIATED AN APPROACH TO A GRASSY AREA NEAR THE SHORELINE; HOWEVER, DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF PEOPLE NEARBY, HE TURNED THE HELICOPTER SLIGHTLY LEFT TO LAND IN THE WATER AS CLOSE TO SHORE AS POSSIBLE. THE PILOT SAID THAT, ABOUT 20 FT ABOVE THE WATER, IT FELT LIKE THE MAIN ROTOR STALLED, THE HELICOPTER LOST LIFT, AND IT ""FELL OUT OF THE SKY."" THE HELICOPTER DESCENDED RAPIDLY INTO THE WATER AND SANK ABOUT 20 FT FROM THE SHORELINE.

THREE OF THE PASSENGERS WERE ABLE TO EGRESS THE HELICOPTER FOLLOWING IMPACT; HOWEVER, THE MIDDLE AFT SEAT PASSENGER WAS TRAPPED INSIDE. A FIRST RESPONDER STATED THAT HE AND ANOTHER PERSON REPEATEDLY DOVE UNDERWATER TO CUT THE PASSENGER'S SEATBELT STRAPS AND EXTRACT HIM. THE FIRST RESPONDER REPORTED THAT THE PASSENGER'S LIFE PRESERVER APPEARED TO BE ENTANGLED WITH THE SEATBELTS. POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE LIFE PRESERVER REVEALED SIGNATURES OF INFLATION AND CUT WAIST STRAPS, WITH NO OTHER DAMAGE NOTED. IT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED WHEN OR HOW THE LIFE PRESERVER WAS INFLATED; THE FIRST RESPONDER COULD NOT RECALL WHETHER IT WAS INFLATED AND THE NURSE PROVIDING CPR SAID IT WAS NOT INFLATED. REVIEW OF TREATMENT RECORDS FOR THE PASSENGER REVEALED EVIDENCE CONSISTENT WITH DROWNING, AND NO TRAUMATIC INJURIES TO THE HEAD OR NECK. IT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED WHETHER THE PASSENGER WAS UNABLE TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF FROM THE RESTRAINT, OR IF HE HAD A PERIOD OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS RESULTING FROM THE IMPACT THAT CONTRIBUTED TO HIS DROWNING. THE HELICOPTER'S DOORS WERE NOT INSTALLED AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT AND ALL FIVE SEAT RESTRAINTS WERE FOUND TO BE IN WORKING ORDER AND UNDAMAGED.

POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER REVEALED THAT THE ENGINE-TO-TRANSMISSION DRIVE SHAFT WAS SEPARATED AT THE TRANSMISSION SIDE. METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE-TO-TRANSMISSION DRIVE SHAFT COMPONENTS REVEALED THAT THE FORWARD COUPLING DID NOT APPEAR TO BE LUBRICATED AND THAT THERE WERE MULTIPLE INDICATIONS OF EXPOSURE TO ELEVATED TEMPERATURE, SUCH AS HEAT TINTING AND LOSS OF THE TEMPERATURE PLATES ON THE FORWARD OUTER COUPLING, HIGH-TEMPERATURE CADMIUM-INDUCED BRITTLE FRACTURE OF TWO FORWARD ATTACHMENT BOLT HEADS, AND A LOSS OF HARDNESS OF THE BOLT HEAD MATERIAL DUE TO HIGH-TEMPERATURE TEMPERING. THE EXTERNAL SPLINE TEETH ON THE FORWARD SPHERICAL COUPLING WERE WORN DOWN TO THE BOTTOM LANDINGS, WHILE COMPARATIVELY MINOR WEAR MARKS WERE OBSERVED ON THE MATING INTERNAL SPLINE TEETH OF THE FORWARD OUTER COUPLING. THE ASYMMETRY IN THE WEAR PATTERN BETWEEN THE SPHERICAL COUPLING AND THE OUTER COUPLING COMBINED WITH THE OBSERVATIONS CONSISTENT WITH ELEVATED TEMPERATURES INDICATE THAT THE ASSEMBLY LIKELY FAILED BY OVERHEATING DUE TO LACK OF LUBRICATION. THIS RESULTED IN SOFTENING AND SUBSEQUENT FAILURE OF THE SPRING THAT LIMITS AND CENTERS THE SPHERICAL COUPLING. WHEN THE SPRING FAILED, THE COUPLING SHIFTED FORWARD, DAMAGING THE FORWARD END OF THE OUTER COUPLING, FRACTURING THE FORWARD COVER PLATE, AND WEARING THE EXTERNAL SPLINE TEETH DOWN TO THE BOTTOM LANDINGS. FOLLOWING THE FAILURE OF THE DRIVE SHAFT, THE ENGINE WOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO OPERATE, BUT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DRIVE THE MAIN ROTOR.

 

INTERVIEWS WITH THE PILOT, THE OWNER OF THE COMPANY, AND A NON-MECHANIC RATED MAINTENANCE ASSISTANT INDICATED THAT MAINTENANCE HAD RECENTLY BEEN CONDUCTED ON THE ENGINE-TO-TRANSMISSION DRIVE SHAFT, EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS NOT RECORDED IN THE HELICOPTER'S MAINTENANCE RECORDS. IN ADDITION, THE OWNER, WHO WAS A RATED MECHANIC, WAS NOT PRESENT THE ENTIRE TIME THROUGHOUT THE REMOVAL, INSPECTION, AND SUBSEQUENT REINSTALLATION OF THE ENGINE-TO-TRANSMISSION DRIVE SHAFT.  

 

IT IS LIKELY THAT, WHEN THIS MAINTENANCE WAS CONDUCTED, GREASE WAS NOT APPLIED TO THE FORWARD COUPLING AS SPECIFIED IN THE MANUFACTURER'S MAINTENANCE MANUAL. FURTHER REVIEW OF MAINTENANCE RECORDS REVEALED NO ENTRIES PERTAINING TO A CURRENT ANNUAL INSPECTION OR 100-HOUR INSPECTION. ADDITIONALLY, A COMPONENT INSPECTION SHEET PROVIDED BY THE OPERATOR REVEALED THAT SEVERAL REQUIRED COMPONENT INSPECTIONS WERE OVERDUE AND HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETED AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. 

 

ALTHOUGH THE FAA WAS CONDUCTING OVERSIGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR GUIDANCE, INCREASED INSPECTIONS MAY HAVE UNCOVERED THE INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE AND DOCUMENTATION, WHICH IN TURN, MAY HAVE PREVENTED THE ACCIDENT.","THE IN-FLIGHT FAILURE OF THE ENGINE-TO-TRANSMISSION DRIVE SHAFT DUE TO IMPROPER MAINTENANCE, WHICH RESULTED IN LOW MAIN ROTOR RPM AND A SUBSEQUENT HARD LANDING TO WATER."

METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS

THE SOUTHWEST SECTION OF THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE SURFACE ANALYSIS CHART DEPICTED A THERMAL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WEST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE. THE CLOSEST UPPER AIR SOUNDING FROM YUMA, ARIZONA, ABOUT 90 MILES SOUTH OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, DEPICTED THERMAL PROFILES THAT SUPPORTED STRONG THERMALS THROUGH 8,500 FT. THE LIFTED INDEX (A COMMON MEASURE OF ATMOSPHERIC INSTABILITY) AND THE K-INDEX (A MEASURE OF THUNDERSTORM POTENTIAL) INDICATED CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO DEVELOPMENT OF SIGNIFICANT UPDRAFTS OR THERMALS OF RISING AIR AND DUST DEVILS. OTHER WEATHER PRODUCTS SUPPORTED STRONG THERMALS TO 11,000 FT.

TWO PEOPLE NEAR THE ACCIDENT SITE REPORTED SEEING NUMEROUS LARGE DUST DEVILS. ONE PERSON WAS AN AIRFRAME AND POWERPLANT MECHANIC DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY, AND HE SAW AS MANY AS FIVE DUST DEVILS SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE OTHER PERSON WAS THE PILOT OF AN R44 WHO WAS PERFORMING AERIAL SURVEY WORK IMMEDIATELY NORTH OF THE ACCIDENT SITE. HE STATED THAT BEGINNING AT 1130 THE WINDS BECAME STRONGER AND GUSTIER. OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS, HE OBSERVED NUMEROUS DUST DEVILS, AND EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT UPDRAFT IN EXCESS OF 1,000 FT PER MINUTE. ABOUT 1515, HE DECIDED TO DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS AND ENCOUNTERED A SIGNIFICANT WIND SHIFT WHILE RETURNING TO HIS BASE.

A DUST DEVIL IS A STRONG, WELL-FORMED WHIRLWIND THAT CAN RANGE FROM A FEW FEET TO HUNDREDS OF FEET WIDE, AND CAN REACH HEIGHTS OF SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET. IN THE UNITED STATES, DUST DEVILS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN EVERY STATE WITH ARIZONA REPORTING THE HIGHEST FREQUENCIES OF OCCURRENCE, AND THEY ARE MOST FREQUENT BETWEEN JUNE AND AUGUST. THEY HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED AS A CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN ABOUT 50 AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS BETWEEN 2000 AND 2015 ACCORDING TO THE NTSB DATABASE.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER CAME TO REST IN HILLY DESERT TERRAIN. THE DEBRIS FIELD WAS ABOUT 750 YARDS LONG AND 150 YARDS WIDE. ONE OF THE FIRST PIECES IDENTIFIED WAS THE OUTBOARD 5 FT OF A MAIN ROTOR BLADE AFTERBODY THAT HAD SEPARATED FROM THE LEADING EDGE SPAR AND DISPLAYED BLACK PAINT TRANSFER MARKS NEAR THE TIP. IT WAS LOCATED ON THE TOP OF A SMALL RIDGELINE. THE INBOARD SECTION OF THIS MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS ABOUT 600 YARDS INTO THE DEBRIS FIELD AND 85 YARDS LEFT OF THE DEBRIS PATH CENTERLINE.

THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HELICOPTER WAS MORE FRAGMENTED THAN THE RIGHT; LEFT SIDE CABIN PIECES AND INSTRUMENTS WERE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE EARLY PART OF THE DEBRIS FIELD. THE TAIL BOOM WAS ABOUT MIDWAY INTO THE DEBRIS FIELD. THE LEFT SIDE/NOSE CABIN, WHICH WAS LOCATED NEAR THE TAIL BOOM HAD A STRAIGHT SEPARATION LINE OR SLICE ACROSS ONE SIDE, AND SOME FLOOR PANELS AT THE AFT END OF THE SLICE WERE CRUSHED IN AN ACCORDION PATTERN. THE CABIN CAME TO REST INVERTED ABOUT 600 YARDS INTO THE DEBRIS FIELD, AND WAS DESTROYED BY A POSTCRASH FIRE. THE ENGINE REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE CABIN.

THE TRANSMISSION, MAST, AND SECOND MAIN ROTOR BLADE SEPARATED AS A UNIT, AND WERE ABOUT 100 YARDS PAST THE CABIN AREA IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CENTERLINE OF THE DEBRIS FIELD. THE CONING BOLT OF THE SEPARATED BLADE WAS BENT, AND THE TEETER STOPS FOR BOTH BLADES HAD IMPACT MARKS ACROSS THEIR CENTERS. THE ATTACHED BLADE WAS BENT MIDSPAN ABOUT 10° TO 20° OPPOSITE THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION. THE MAIN ROTOR DRIVESHAFT WAS BENT ABOUT 15° AT THE SWASHPLATE.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ROBINSON SAFETY NOTICE SN-32 DISCUSSES FLIGHT IN HIGH WINDS AND TURBULENCE AND EXPLAINS HOW IMPROPER APPLICATION OF CONTROL INPUTS IN RESPONSE TO TURBULENCE CAN INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A MAST BUMPING ACCIDENT. IT RECOMMENDS THAT PILOTS REDUCE AIRSPEED BELOW NORMAL CRUISE SPEED TO 60 TO 70 KNOTS FOR FLIGHT IN SIGNIFICANT TURBULENCE. IT SUGGESTS TECHNIQUES TO AVOID OVERCONTROL OF THE HELICOPTER, AND SAYS TO AVOID FLYING ON THE DOWNWIND SIDE OF HILLS AND RIDGES.","THE COMMERCIAL PILOT AND THE PILOT-RATED PASSENGER DEPARTED ON A CROSS-COUNTRY POSITIONING FLIGHT.

ON JULY 6, 2016, ABOUT 1148 CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME, AN EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BELL 525 HELICOPTER, N525TA, BROKE UP IN FLIGHT AND IMPACTED TERRAIN NEAR ITALY, TEXAS. THE TWO TEST PILOTS RECEIVED FATAL INJURIES, AND THE HELICOPTER WAS DESTROYED. THE HELICOPTER, WHICH WAS OWNED BY BELL HELICOPTER TEXTRON, INC., WAS BEING OPERATED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS (CFR) PART 91 AS A DEVELOPMENTAL FLIGHT TEST. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. THE FLIGHT ORIGINATED FROM ARLINGTON MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, ARLINGTON, TEXAS.

ABOUT 0630 ON THE MORNING OF THE ACCIDENT, THE TWO TEST PILOTS, FLIGHT TEST ENGINEERS, AND A CHASE HELICOPTER FLIGHT CREW BRIEFED THE PLANNED FLIGHT. THE BRIEF DETAILED THAT THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER, ACCOMPANIED BY A CHASE HELICOPTER, WOULD PROCEED TO THE ARLINGTON INITIAL EXPERIMENTAL TEST AREA (ABOUT 30 MILES SOUTH OF ARLINGTON MUNICIPAL AIRPORT) TO PERFORM THE IN-FLIGHT PORTION OF THE TESTS. THE PURPOSE OF THE FLIGHT WAS TO EVALUATE ENGINE LOADS AT MAXIMUM CONTINUOUS POWER, TWO-TO-ONE-ENGINE SIMULATED ENGINE FAILURES, LONGITUDINAL ROLL OSCILLATIONS, AND RUN-ON LANDINGS IN THE HEAVY, FORWARD CENTER-OF-GRAVITY CONFIGURATION. 

THE TEST CARD FOR THE TWO-TO-ONE-ENGINE SIMULATED ENGINE FAILURE DETAILED THAT THE PILOTS WOULD SIMULATE THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER FROM ONE ENGINE WHILE KEEPING BOTH ENGINES OPERATING BY USING ONE-ENGINE-INOPERATIVE (OEI) SPECIAL TRAINING MODE SOFTWARE, WHICH REDUCED THE POWER OUTPUT OF BOTH ENGINES TO REPRESENT THE MAXIMUM POWER THAT CAN BE PRODUCED BY ONE ENGINE. WHEN THE OEI SPECIAL TRAINING MODE WAS ENGAGED AND A LOSS OF POWER WAS SIMULATED, THE PILOT WOULD MONITOR ROTOR ROTATION SPEED (NR) AND INTENTIONALLY DELAY HIS RESPONSE BY ABOUT 1 SECOND BEFORE RECOVERING FROM THE MANEUVER BY LOWERING THE COLLECTIVE TO REDUCE THE POWER DEMANDED BY THE ROTOR (AND INCREASE NR). THE LOWEST ALLOWABLE NR LIMIT WAS IDENTIFIED AS 86%; IF NR WENT BELOW 86%, THE TEST WOULD BE HALTED, AND THE CREW WOULD RECOVER NR TO 103%, EXIT OEI SPECIAL TRAINING MODE, AND RETURN TO STEADY LEVEL FLIGHT. A BELL STRUCTURAL ENGINEER STATED THAT FLIGHT BELOW 86% NR WOULD RESULT IN THE HELICOPTER RETURNING TO BASE. DURING TEST FLIGHTS, FLIGHT TEST ENGINEERS MONITOR REAL-TIME TELEMETRY DATA FROM THE HELICOPTER UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF THE FLIGHT TEST DIRECTOR, WHO WAS IN DIRECT RADIO COMMUNICATIONS WITH BOTH THE TEST HELICOPTER PILOTS AND THE CHASE HELICOPTER PILOTS.

ABOUT 0959, WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE DETERMINED TO BE ACCEPTABLE FOR THE FLIGHT, AND ABOUT 1038, THE HELICOPTER DEPARTED FOR THE TEST AREA, FOLLOWED BY THE CHASE HELICOPTER. ABOUT 1048, THE PILOTS ESTABLISHED THE HELICOPTER'S MAXIMUM LEVEL FLIGHT AIRSPEED (VH) AT 4,000 FT DENSITY ALTITUDE (DA) AS 148 KNOTS CALIBRATED AIRSPEED (KCAS). AFTER PERFORMING STEADY-HEADING SIDESLIPS, THE PILOTS PERFORMED A SERIES OF LEVEL TURNS AND THEN BEGAN THE TWO-TO-ONE-ENGINE SIMULATED ENGINE FAILURES.

ABOUT 1108, THE PILOTS SET THE OEI TRAINING MODE SHAFT HORSEPOWER TO A VALUE PREDETERMINED BY THE FLIGHT ENGINEERS. THE FIRST THREE TESTS WERE PERFORMED IN LEVEL FLIGHT AT 102 KCAS, 131 KCAS, AND 145 KCAS. THE PILOTS THEN PERFORMED TESTS AT 155 KNOTS TRUE AIRSPEED (KTAS), 160 KTAS, 165 KTAS, AND 175 KTAS, WHICH REQUIRED THE HELICOPTER TO BE IN A SHALLOW DESCENT TO ACHIEVE THE REQUIRED AIRSPEED. THESE OEI TESTS HAD RESULTED IN A ROTOR SPEED DECAY OF 5 TO 13% NR. DURING THESE TESTS, TO ALLOW NR TO RECOVER TO 97% OR GREATER, THE CREW LOWERED THE COLLECTIVE INPUT TO NEAR OR BELOW 50%. (100% IS THE FULL-UP COLLECTIVE POSITION, AND 0% IS THE FULL-DOWN COLLECTIVE POSITION.) DATA RECORDED ON THE HELICOPTER'S FLIGHT TEST RECORDER SYSTEM, WHICH WAS TYPICALLY DOWNLOADED AFTER EACH TEST FLIGHT AND ALSO TRANSMITTED VIA A TELEMETRY STREAM TO BELL'S FLIGHT-TEST FACILITY FOR REAL-TIME ANALYSIS AND RECORDING, INDICATE THE BUILD-UP TESTS AND RECOVERY TIME REQUIRED (SEE TABLE 1). (RECORD 45 WAS A VOID RECORD, AND RECORD 49 WAS ABORTED BECAUSE OF TWO ENGINE TORQUE SPIKES TYPICAL OF WIND GUST ENCOUNTERS.)

TABLE 1. BUILD-UP TESTS AND RECOVERY TIME REQUIRED.



DURING THE BUILD UP TO THE FINAL TEST, THE FLIGHT TEST ENGINEERS RECEIVED WARNING AND ALERT NOTIFICATIONS, MOST OF WHICH RELATED TO MAIN ROTOR AND TAIL ROTOR PITCH LINK LOADS, PYLON LOADS, AND TAIL BOOM LOADS. THESE ALERTS AND WARNINGS WERE EXPECTED AS THE AIRSPEED INCREASED AND THE DYNAMIC LOADS ON THE ROTOR SYSTEM AND AIRFRAME ALSO INCREASED. DURING MOST OF THE OEI TRANSITIONS, THE PILOT RESPONDED BY LOWERING THE COLLECTIVE BETWEEN 1 AND 2 SECONDS AFTER THE SIMULATED LOSS OF ENGINE POWER. HOWEVER, WITH EACH INCREASE IN AIRSPEED, THE TIME THE CREW TOOK TO RECOVER NR TO THE TARGET VALUE OF 103% WAS LONGER. BELL TEST PILOTS INDICATED THAT THEY INTERPRETED THIS TREND AS THE TENDENCY OF THE CREW TO BE MORE JUDICIOUS WHILE APPLYING COLLECTIVE AT SUCCESSIVELY HIGHER AIRSPEEDS IN ORDER TO AVOID RECOVERING TOO FAST AND OVERSPEEDING THE ROTOR OR DAMAGING THE TRANSMISSION.

ABOUT 1148, THE FINAL TEST WAS PERFORMED AT 185 KTAS, WHICH WAS THE HELICOPTER'S NEVER-TO-EXCEED SPEED (VNE) AT THE TIME OF THE TEST FLIGHT; THE SET UP AND ENTRY WERE THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS TESTS. OEI WAS ENGAGED, AND NR DROOPED TO ABOUT 91% WITHIN 1.5 SECONDS. THE NR DECAY WAS STOPPED BY THE PILOT'S REDUCTION OF COLLECTIVE, AND NR BEGAN TO RECOVER AND LEVELED OUT AROUND 92%. THE CREW STOPPED LOWERING THE COLLECTIVE AT THE 58% COLLECTIVE STICK POSITION. ABOUT 7 SECONDS AFTER ARRESTING THE NR DECAY (ABOUT 12 SECONDS INTO THE TEST), THE STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS ENGINEER NOTICED INCREASED ENGINE VIBRATIONS, AT WHICH POINT HE CALLED ""KNOCK-IT-OFF."" THE TEST DIRECTOR RADIOED TO THE BELL 525 PILOTS TO ""KNOCK-IT-OFF,"" WHILE OTHER ENGINEERS IN THE TELEMETRY ROOM WERE RECEIVING WARNINGS AND ALERTS AND WERE REINFORCING THE ""KNOCK-IT-OFF"" CALL.

THE CREW OF THE CHASE HELICOPTER, WHICH WAS POSITIONED ABOUT 100 FT ABOVE AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BELL 525 ABOUT 3 TO 4 ROTOR DIAMETERS AWAY, HEARD THE TEST DIRECTOR CALL ""KNOCK-IT-OFF"" ABOUT THE SAME TIME THEY OBSERVED THE 525'S ROTOR BLADES FLYING HIGH AND THE ROTOR LOOKING WOBBLY AND SLOW. THE CHASE HELICOPTER CREW RADIOED, ""HEY, YOU'RE FLAPPING PRETTY GOOD,"" BUT THE 525 PILOTS DID NOT RESPOND. ABOUT 21 SECONDS INTO THE TEST, THE MAIN ROTOR SEVERED THE TAIL BOOM, AND THE TELEMETRY SIGNAL WAS LOST. THE CHASE HELICOPTER CREW OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER'S TAIL AND FUSELAGE JACK-KNIFE AND DEBRIS SEPARATE FROM THE HELICOPTER. THE CHASE HELICOPTER CREW RADIOED TO THE TEST DIRECTOR, ""WE'VE HAD A MAJOR ACCIDENT,"" AND LANDED NEAR THE WRECKAGE TO ATTEMPT ASSISTANCE.

FIGURE 1. ACCIDENT HELICOPTER (BELL 525, N525TA).

SOURCE: BELL HELICOPTER

THE BELL 525 HELICOPTER HAD A FIVE-BLADED MAIN ROTOR THAT PROVIDED HELICOPTER LIFT AND THRUST AND ROTATED IN A COUNTERCLOCKWISE DIRECTION WHEN VIEWED FROM ABOVE. THE MAIN ROTOR WAS A FULLY ARTICULATED SYSTEM THAT USED ELASTOMERIC BEARINGS TO ACCOMMODATE BLADE FEATHERING, FLAPPING, AND LEAD-LAG MOTIONS. FLUID-ELASTIC DAMPERS MODERATED LEAD-LAG MOTION OF THE BLADES. THE FIVE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE IDENTIFIED BY COLORED STICKERS, PRESENTED IN ORDER OF ADVANCING ROTATION (WHEN SEATED IN THE PILOT SEAT AND OBSERVING THE BLADES PASS FROM RIGHT TO LEFT): BLUE, ORANGE, RED, GREEN, AND WHITE. THE BELL 525 ALSO HAD A FOUR-BLADED, FULLY ARTICULATED, CANTED TAIL ROTOR THAT PROVIDED THRUST TO COUNTERACT MAIN ROTOR TORQUE EFFECT, CONTROL HELICOPTER YAW, AND PROVIDE LIFT. THE FOUR TAIL ROTOR BLADES WERE IDENTIFIED BY COLORED STICKERS, PRESENTED IN ORDER OF ADVANCING ROTATION: BLUE, ORANGE, RED, AND GREEN. THE HELICOPTER WAS EQUIPPED WITH TWO GENERAL ELECTRIC (GE) CT7-2F1 TURBOSHAFT ENGINES, MOUNTED AFT OF THE MAIN TRANSMISSION, AND ONE HONEYWELL RE100BR AUXILIARY POWER UNIT (APU), MOUNTED BETWEEN THE TWO ENGINES AT THE AFT END OF THE ENGINE DECK. THE HELICOPTER WAS EQUIPPED WITH A TRIPLE-REDUNDANT FLY-BY-WIRE FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM WITH A TRIPLEX HYDRAULIC SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY, THE HELICOPTER WAS EQUIPPED WITH RETRACTABLE TRICYCLE LANDING GEAR. 

THE COCKPIT WAS CONFIGURED FOR TWO PILOTS IN A SIDE-BY-SIDE SEATED POSITION AND A CENTER CONSOLE BETWEEN THEM. EACH PILOT HAD A CYCLIC SIDE-STICK CONTROLLER FORWARD OF THE SEAT'S RIGHT ARMREST, A COLLECTIVE SIDE-STICK CONTROLLER IMMEDIATELY FORWARD OF THE SEAT'S LEFT ARM REST, AND A SET OF PEDALS FORWARD OF THEIR FEET. THE INSTRUMENT PANEL CONSISTED OF FOUR IDENTICAL PRIMARY FLIGHT DISPLAY (PFD)/MULTIFUNCTION DISPLAY (MFD) PANELS. THE CENTER CONSOLE HAD TWO GARMIN TOUCH CONTROL (GTC) PANELS, THE LANDING GEAR HANDLE, THE NAV/COM PANEL, AND THE FLIGHT TEST SWITCH PANEL, WHICH INCLUDED SOME CONTROLS FOR THE OEI SPECIAL TRAINING MODE SOFTWARE. DIRECTLY ABOVE THE GTCS WERE THE ENGINE CONTROL COSIF (CRANK, OFF, START, IDLE, FLY) KNOBS. EACH PILOT HAD AN ADDITIONAL PILOT DISPLAY UNIT THAT PROVIDED REAL-TIME FLIGHT TEST INSTRUMENTATION PARAMETERS SUCH AS DA, BOOM AIRSPEED, MAST AIRSPEED, ENGINE TORQUE, LOAD FACTOR, PITCH/YAW/ROLL RATES, SLIP ANGLE, AND MAIN ROTOR AND TAIL ROTOR FLAPPING ANGLES.

OEI TRAINING MODE

OEI TRAINING MODE IS A SPECIFIC GE SOFTWARE-DRIVEN CAPABILITY THAT PERMITS SIMULATION OF A SINGLE-ENGINE FAILURE WITHOUT ACTUALLY ROLLING BACK OR SHUTTING DOWN AN ENGINE IN FLIGHT. WHEN THE FLIGHT CREW ENGAGES THE OEI TRAINING MODE, BOTH ENGINES REDUCE POWER TO REPRESENT THE POWER AVAILABLE FROM A SINGLE ENGINE. CONSISTENT WITH NORMAL OPERATIONS AND DEPENDING ON THE FLIGHT CONDITIONS, IF THE POWER DEMANDED BY THE ROTOR EXCEEDS THE POWER AVAILABLE, NR WILL DROOP. IF SINGLE-ENGINE POWER IS INSUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN THE FORWARD SPEED, THE PILOT MUST REDUCE THE POWER DEMAND BY LOWERING THE COLLECTIVE CONTROL, APPLYING AFT CYCLIC (TO REDUCE SPEED), OR USING A COMBINATION OF BOTH. NR INCREASES TO 103% WHEN THE POWER REQUIRED MATCHES THE SINGLE-ENGINE POWER AVAILABLE.

TO ENGAGE OEI TRAINING, THE PILOT OR COPILOT NAVIGATES TO THE OEI TRAINING PAGE ON THE GTC AND SELECTS THE ENGINE TO FAIL ON THE TOUCH SCREEN. ONCE SELECTED, A GREEN BAR APPEARS ON THE FAILED ENGINE BUTTON TO SIGNAL THAT OEI TRAINING MODE WAS ENGAGED (SEE FIGURE 2). WHEN OEI TRAINING MODE IS ENGAGED, THE PILOT'S SIDE (RIGHT-SEAT) PFD DISPLAYS SIMULATED OEI ENGINE VALUES, AND THE COPILOT'S SIDE (LEFT-SEAT) PFD DISPLAYS THE ACTUAL ALL-ENGINES-OPERATIVE (AEO) DATA.

THE OEI SPECIAL TRAINING MODE THAT BELL USED FOR THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT TEST DID NOT INCORPORATE AN AUTOMATIC DISENGAGEMENT OF OEI TRAINING MODE FOR LOW NR. BELL MODIFIED THE PRODUCTION VERSION OF OEI TRAINING MODE SOFTWARE, ORIGINALLY CREATED BY GE, TO ELIMINATE A SAFEGUARD THAT AUTOMATICALLY EXITED THE OEI TRAINING MODE WHEN NR FELL BELOW 90%. ACCORDING TO BELL, AUTOMATIC DISENGAGEMENT AT 90% NR WAS NOT LOW ENOUGH TO ALLOW DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION OF OEI RECOVERY ACROSS THE FLIGHT ENVELOPE DURING TESTING, AND A LOWER NR VALUE FOR AUTOMATIC DISENGAGEMENT WAS DEEMED UNNECESSARY DUE TO THE HIGHLY CONTROLLED TEST ENVIRONMENT. TO MANUALLY EXIT OEI TRAINING MODE, THE PILOT COULD (1) PRESS THE ENGINE FAIL BUTTON ON THE GTC (THE SAME BUTTON USED TO ENGAGE OEI TRAINING MODE), (2) EXIT THE OEI TRAINING PAGE ON THE GTC (USING THE BACK BUTTON), OR (3) MOVE THE COSIF SWITCH TO A POSITION OTHER THAN ""FLY"" AND THEN RETURN THE SWITCH TO ""FLY."" THE BELL 525 LEAD TEST PILOT INDICATED IN A POSTACCIDENT INTERVIEW THAT THE OPTIONS TO EXIT OEI TRAINING MODE WERE NOT DISCUSSED FORMALLY WITH ALL THE TEST PILOTS BUT WERE SPECIFICALLY DISCUSSED WITH THE ACCIDENT TEST PILOT. BELL 525 TEST PILOTS INTERVIEWED SAID THAT THEY ALMOST ALWAYS PRESS THE ENGINE FAIL BUTTON ON THE GTC TO EXIT OEI TRAINING MODE; SOME BELL PILOTS WERE AWARE OF THE OTHER METHODS TO EXIT OEI TRAINING MODE WHILE OTHER TEST PILOTS WERE NOT. DISENGAGING OEI TRAINING MODE WOULD MAKE BOTH ENGINES AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE FULL POWER TO RESTORE THE REFERENCE NR TO 100% IF THE ROTOR WAS IN A DROOPED STATE. 

THE PRODUCTION OEI TRAINING MODE, WHICH WILL BE USED IN BELL 525 PRODUCTION HELICOPTERS, INCLUDES AN AUTOMATIC DISENGAGEMENT OF OEI TRAINING IF NR DECAYS BELOW 90% (PENDING VALIDATION VIA TESTING). IN THE PRODUCTION OEI TRAINING MODE, AUTOMATIC EXIT WOULD OCCUR IN THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES:

-LOSS OF AN ENGINE.
-TORQUES OF THE TWO ENGINES ARE NOT WITHIN ~30 FT-LB OF EACH OTHER.
-THERE ARE ANY SIGNIFICANT ENGINE FAILURES (ANY FAULT THAT WOULD CAUSE LOCAL CHANNEL DEGRADED ON ANY OF THE 4 CHANNELS). IF THE ENABLE BIT FOR TRAINING IS SET (BIT 20) AND BOTH ENGINE REQUEST BITS ARE SET (BIT 21 AND 22). TO ENGAGE TRAINING ONLY ONE-ENGINE REQUEST BIT CAN BE SET.
-POWER TURBINE SPEED (NP) IS 5% BELOW THE REFERENCE VALUE (HAVING PREVIOUSLY BEEN WITHIN 1% OF THE REFERENCE WHILE IN TRAINING) OR TO A VALUE BELOW 90%.
-NP IS ABOVE 106%.
-REAL ENGINE GAS PRODUCER TURBINE SPEED IS ABOVE 106%.
-REAL ENGINE MEASURED GAS TEMPERATURE IS ABOVE 1934.3° F/ 1056.8° C.
-REAL SINGLE-ENGINE TORQUE IS ABOVE 521 FT-LB (67.7%).
-REAL ENGINE OIL TEMPERATURE IS ABOVE 148.89° C.
-LOW OIL PRESSURE SWITCH IS TRIPPED.

OEI TRAINING MODE FLIGHT TEST RISK ANALYSIS WORKSHEETS DOCUMENTED PLANNED OPERATIONAL RISK MITIGATION FOR OEI TRAINING. A WORKSHEET APPROVED ON JUNE 29, 2015, INCLUDED A DISCUSSION OF THE RISK OF LOW NR, AND A WORKSHEET APPROVED ON APRIL 1, 2016, INCLUDED A DISCUSSION ABOUT ENGINE OVERTORQUING.

POWER SITUATION INDICATOR (PSI)

THE PSI WAS LOCATED IN THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER OF THE PFD FOR EACH PILOT. THE BARS IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF THE PSI REPRESENTED NP FOR THE NUMBER 1 ENGINE, NR, AND NP FOR THE NUMBER 2 ENGINE, RESPECTIVELY. THE ARC IN THE CENTER OF THE DISPLAY DEPICTED THE PERCENTAGE OF ENGINE VALUE COMPARED TO ITS LIMIT (SEE FIGURE 3).

POWER SITUATION INDICATOR

THE PSI DISPLAYED NR AS A VERTICAL SCALE (CENTER BAR IN LOWER RIGHT INDICATOR) WHEN NR WAS ABOVE 90%, AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 3. IF NR DROPPED BELOW 90%, THE DISPLAY CHANGED TO AN ANALOG NEEDLE THAT DISPLAYED A GREEN ARC FOR NR BETWEEN 100 AND 90%, A YELLOW ARC FOR NR BETWEEN 86 AND 89%","THE EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HELICOPTER WAS UNDERGOING DEVELOPMENTAL FLIGHT TESTS BEFORE TYPE CERTIFICATION. ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, THE HELICOPTER TEST CREW WAS PERFORMING A SERIES OF ONE-ENGINE-INOPERATIVE (OEI) TESTS AT INCREASING AIRSPEEDS WITH A HEAVY, FORWARD CENTER-OF-GRAVITY CONFIGURATION. (FOR THE OEI TESTS, THE PILOTS USED OEI SPECIAL TRAINING MODE SOFTWARE TO REDUCE THE POWER OF BOTH ENGINES TO A LEVEL THAT SIMULATED THE LOSS OF ONE ENGINE.) THE CREW INITIATED THE FINAL PLANNED OEI TEST AT A SPEED OF 185 KNOTS. AFTER THE CREW ENGAGED OEI SPECIAL TRAINING MODE, ROTOR ROTATION SPEED (NR) DECAYED FROM 100% TO ABOUT 91%, AND THE CREW BEGAN LOWERING THE COLLECTIVE TO STOP NR DECAY AND INCREASE NR TO 103% (THE TARGET NR FOR RECOVERY). ABOUT 5.5 SECONDS INTO THE TEST, THE CREW STOPPED LOWERING THE COLLECTIVE, AND NR ONLY RECOVERED TO ABOUT 92%. ABOUT 6 TO 7 SECONDS INTO THE TEST, THE HELICOPTER BEGAN VIBRATING AT A FREQUENCY OF 6 HERTZ (HZ). THE VIBRATION WAS EVIDENT IN BOTH ROTOR SYSTEMS, THE AIRFRAME, THE PILOT SEATS, AND THE CONTROL INPUTS; THE VERTICAL VIBRATION AMPLITUDE AT THE PILOT SEAT PEAKED ABOUT 3 G. (G IS A UNIT OF MEASUREMENT OF ACCELERATION; 1 G IS EQUIVALENT TO THE ACCELERATION CAUSED BY THE EARTH'S GRAVITY [ABOUT 32.2 FT/SEC2].) NR REMAINED BETWEEN ABOUT 90% AND 92% UNTIL ABOUT 12 TO 13 SECONDS INTO THE TEST, THEN BEGAN FLUCTUATING CONSISTENT WITH COLLECTIVE CONTROL INPUTS; SUBSEQUENT COLLECTIVE CONTROL INPUT INCREASES LED TO FURTHER DECAY IN NR. NR DECAYED TO ABOUT 80% AS THE COLLECTIVE WAS RAISED, AND THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES BEGAN TO FLAP OUT OF PLANE. ABOUT 21 SECONDS INTO THE TEST, THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES FLAPPED LOW ENOUGH TO IMPACT THE TAIL BOOM, SEVERING IT AND CAUSING THE IN-FLIGHT BREAKUP OF THE HELICOPTER. 

THE MAIN ROTOR, TAIL ROTOR, FLIGHT CONTROLS, POWERPLANTS, AND ROTOR DRIVE SYSTEMS EXHIBITED NO EVIDENCE OF PREEXISTING MALFUNCTION BEFORE THE VIBRATIONS BEGAN. THE STRUCTURAL WRECKAGE DID NOT EXHIBIT EVIDENCE THAT THE OSCILLATIONS THEMSELVES RESULTED IN A STRUCTURAL FAILURE LEADING TO THE IN-FLIGHT BREAKUP. EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED NO INDICATIONS THAT THE HELICOPTER HAD BEEN IMPROPERLY MAINTAINED.

 HELICOPTER PERFORMANCE AFTER STOP IN NR RECOVERY

DURING PREVIOUS OEI TESTS, THE CREW LOWERED THE COLLECTIVE INPUT TO NEAR OR BELOW 50% TO ALLOW NR TO RECOVER. AS AIRSPEED INCREASED DURING EACH TEST, THE CREW TOOK LONGER TO RECOVER NR TO 103%. (AT 102 KNOTS, RECOVERY TIME WAS 3.4 SECONDS, AND AT 175 KNOTS, RECOVERY TIME WAS 13 SECONDS.) HOWEVER, AFTER INITIATING THE FINAL OEI TEST AT 185 KNOTS, THE CREW ONLY LOWERED THE COLLECTIVE TO 58% AND SUBSEQUENTLY ONLY RECOVERED NR TO 92%. WHILE AT 92%, THE MAIN ROTOR SCISSORS MODE WAS EXCITED. (THE MAIN ROTOR SCISSORS MODE OCCURS WHEN THE LEAD-LAG MOTIONS OF THE BLADES ACT IN SUCH A WAY THAT ADJACENT BLADES MOVE TOGETHER AND APART IN A SCISSORING MOTION. SEE THE FACTUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCISSORS MODE.) THE MAIN ROTOR SCISSORS MODE EXCITATION RESULTED IN THE 6-HZ AIRFRAME VERTICAL VIBRATION, WHICH WAS TRANSMITTED TO THE CREW SEATS AND CREATED A BIOMECHANICAL FEEDBACK LOOP THROUGH THE PILOT-HELD COLLECTIVE CONTROL. A SECOND FEEDBACK SYSTEM, DRIVEN BY THE ATTITUDE AND HEADING REFERENCE SYSTEM (AHRS) INPUTS TO THE MAIN ROTOR SWASHPLATE, ALSO CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE SCISSORS MODE AND ITS RESULTANT 6-HZ AIRFRAME VIBRATION. 

BIOMECHANICAL FEEDBACK

BIOMECHANICAL FEEDBACK IN THE AIRCRAFT DESIGN INDUSTRY REFERS TO UNINTENTIONAL CONTROL INPUTS RESULTING FROM INVOLUNTARY PILOT LIMB MOTIONS CAUSED BY VEHICLE ACCELERATIONS. THE GAIN BETWEEN THE VERTICAL ACCELERATION AND 6-HZ COLLECTIVE STICK MOVEMENT CAN BE CALCULATED BY DIVIDING STICK MOVEMENT BY VERTICAL ACCELERATION. (IF NO BIOMECHANICAL FEEDBACK EXISTED, THERE WOULD BE NO GAIN [0 INCH PER G].) DURING THE ACCIDENT, THE COLLECTIVE STICK MOVED, ON AVERAGE, 0.2 INCH PER EVERY G OF SEAT ACCELERATION. THE ""NONZERO"" RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONTROL STICK AMPLITUDE AND THE SEAT VIBRATION ILLUSTRATES THAT BIOMECHANICAL FEEDBACK CONTRIBUTED TO THE HELICOPTER'S VIBRATION. FURTHER, A POSITIVE VALUE OF PILOT GAIN OCCURRED NEAR 6 HZ, WHICH INDICATES INSTABILITY IN THE SYSTEM (MEANING THAT ANY INPUT TO THE SYSTEM WILL AMPLIFY AS OPPOSED TO DAMPEN). THUS, BIOMECHANICAL FEEDBACK CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASES IN VIBRATION AMPLITUDE DURING THIS ACCIDENT. 

 ALTHOUGH THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER'S DESIGN PROCESS FOR BIOMECHANICAL FEEDBACK INCLUDED SOFTWARE FILTERS IN THE CYCLIC CONTROL LAWS TO REDUCE CERTAIN TYPES OF OSCILLATORY CYCLIC CONTROL INPUTS BY THE PILOT, NO FILTER WAS DESIGNED FOR THE COLLECTIVE. THUS, THE 6-HZ OSCILLATORY COLLECTIVE INPUTS BY THE PILOT WERE NOT FILTERED. AS A RESULT, A CONTROL FEEDBACK LOOP BEGAN WHEN THE PILOT-HELD COLLECTIVE STICK COMMANDED AN OSCILLATORY COLLECTIVE PITCH INPUT (ABOUT 6 HZ) INTO THE MAIN ROTOR, INCREASING THE 6-HZ VIBRATION, WHICH IN TURN INCREASED THE MAGNITUDE OF THE OSCILLATORY (6-HZ) COLLECTIVE PITCH INPUT. 

IN ADDITION, THE GAIN BETWEEN THE PILOT MOVEMENT AND THE COLLECTIVE CONTROL STICK MOVEMENT IN THE VERTICAL AXIS WAS NEVER TESTED ON A SHAKE TABLE BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. FOR THE CYCLIC CONTROL, LATERAL VIBRATION WAS INTRODUCED ON A SHAKE TABLE. THIS TEST WAS CONDUCTED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE HELICOPTER MODEL'S SIDE-STICK CYCLIC SINCE THE MANUFACTURER EXPECTED A DIFFERENT TRANSFER FUNCTION FROM THAT OF A TRADITIONAL CYCLIC. FOR THE COLLECTIVE CONTROL, NO SUCH TEST WAS CONDUCTED DESPITE THIS BEING THE FIRST HELICOPTER WITH A SIDE-STICK COLLECTIVE CONTROL. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DECISION TO NOT SHAKE TEST IN THE VERTICAL AXIS TO INFORM THE PILOT MODEL COULD HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY SCHEDULE PRESSURE, INTERVIEWS DID NOT SUGGEST THAT DECISIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT GIVEN THE LACK OF ANTICIPATION OF SCISSORS MODE AND RESULTING AERODYNAMIC EFFECT. 

ATTITUDE AND HEADING REFERENCE SYSTEM 

THE AHRS IS DESIGNED TO DETECT UNCOMMANDED ACCELERATIONS (SUCH AS THE HELICOPTER'S REACTION TO A GUST OF WIND) AND REDUCE THEIR EFFECTS BY AUTOMATICALLY PROVIDING CORRECTIVE INPUTS TO THE MAIN ROTOR SWASHPLATE. THE AHRS DETECTED AND RESPONDED TO THE 6-HZ AIRFRAME VERTICAL VIBRATION IN A MANNER THAT SUSTAINED THE MAIN ROTOR SCISSORS MODE AND ITS RESULTANT 6-HZ VIBRATION. SPECIFICALLY, ANALYSIS OF THE TELEMETRY DATA REVEALED THAT THE AHRS RESPONDED TO THE 6-HZ VIBRATION WITH INPUTS TO THE MAIN ROTOR SWASHPLATE ANALOGOUS TO A ""CYCLIC STIR"" (WHEN THE CYCLIC CONTROL STICK IS MOVED IN A STIRRING MOTION). THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER'S ASSESSMENT OF THE AHRS-INDUCED CYCLIC STIR SWASHPLATE MOTION WAS THAT IT WOULD EXACERBATE THE MAIN ROTOR SCISSORS MODE. THE AHRS IS INTENDED TO RESPOND PRIMARILY TO LOWER-FREQUENCY UNCOMMANDED ACCELERATIONS. BECAUSE THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER DID NOT PREDICT AN EXCITEMENT OF THE SCISSORS MODE IN THE ACCIDENT TEST FLIGHT CONDITIONS, THE FILTER DESIGN OF THE AHRS ALLOWED IT TO RESPOND TO THE 6-HZ AIRFRAME VIBRATION. THUS, THE AHRS DETECTED AND ATTEMPTED TO ATTENUATE THE 6-HZ AIRFRAME VERTICAL VIBRATION, BUT ITS RESPONSE INSTEAD EXACERBATED THE MAIN ROTOR SCISSORS MODE AND ITS RESULTANT 6-HZ VIBRATION, CLOSING THE AHRS FEEDBACK LOOP.

REASONS FOR CREW STOP IN NR RECOVERY

INVESTIGATORS EXPLORED POSSIBLE REASONS WHY THE CREWMEMBERS STOPPED THEIR RECOVERY FROM THE INITIAL NR DROOP, INCLUDING A REACTION TO AN ABNORMAL CONDITION ON THE HELICOPTER, DISTRACTION FROM THE RECOVERY TASK, OR A CONSERVATIVE RESPONSE DUE TO THE HIGH AIRSPEED. TELEMETRY DATA DOES NOT INDICATE THE EXISTENCE OF AN ABNORMAL CONDITION WHEN THE CREWMEMBERS STOPPED THEIR RECOVERY. IN ADDITION, THE CHASE HELICOPTER CREWMEMBERS REPORTED SEEING NO DISTRACTIONS OR ABNORMALITIES OUTSIDE OF THE HELICOPTER (FOR EXAMPLE, BIRDS).  

THEREFORE, INVESTIGATORS FOCUSED ON THE CREW'S INCREASINGLY CONSERVATIVE RESPONSE AS THE AIRSPEED INCREASED DURING THE TESTS. DURING THE PREVIOUS OEI TESTS, AS AIRSPEED INCREASED, THE CREW RECOVERIES TOOK MORE TIME TO REACH 103% NR AND COLLECTIVE RESPONSE BECAME LESS PRONOUNCED. DURING POSTACCIDENT INTERVIEWS, HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER TEST PILOTS INDICATED THAT THEY INTERPRETED THIS TREND AS THE TENDENCY OF THE CREW TO BE MORE JUDICIOUS WHILE APPLYING COLLECTIVE AT SUCCESSIVELY HIGHER AIRSPEEDS TO AVOID RECOVERING TOO FAST AND OVERSPEEDING THE ROTOR OR DAMAGING THE TRANSMISSION.  THUS, THE CREW MAY HAVE BEEN MORE CONSERVATIVE DURING RECOVERY AT THE HELICOPTER'S HIGH SPEED DURING THE FINAL TEST. THE CHIEF TEST PILOT ALSO STATED THAT IF NR HAD STABILIZED, THE PILOT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN A RUSH AND WAS POSSIBLY INITIATING A SLOW RECOVERY. 

AS AN EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HELICOPTER CONFIGURED TO CARRY TWO PILOTS AND WITH NO PASSENGER SEATING, THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WAS NOT REQUIRED TO BE EQUIPPED WITH EITHER A FLIGHT DATA RECORDER (FDR) OR COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER (CVR) UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS (CFR) 91.609. (WHEN CERTIFIED AS A TRANSPORT-CATEGORY ROTORCRAFT UNDER 14 CFR PART 29, THE HELICOPTER MODEL WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH BOTH CVR AND FDR RECORDING CAPABILITIES.) A COMBINATION CVR AND FDR (CVFDR) WAS INSTALLED IN THE FLIGHT TEST HELICOPTER BUT WAS NOT OPERATIONAL AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. ALTHOUGH INVESTIGATORS WERE ABLE TO EXAMINE AND ANALYZE TELEMETRY DATA, A PROPERLY FUNCTIONING CVFDR WOULD HAVE RECORDED ANY DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE ACCIDENT PILOTS THAT COULD HAVE OFFERED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL ABNORMAL CONDITIONS, DISTRACTIONS, OR REASONS FOR THEIR STOP IN RECOVERY AFTER INITIATION OF THE OEI TEST. ADDITIONALLY, COCKPIT IMAGE RECORDING CAPABILITY WOULD HAVE RECORDED ANY PILOT ACTIONS AND INTERACTIONS WITH THE AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS INCLUDING AVIONICS BUTTON PRESSES, WARNING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, AND ANY OTHER PHYSICAL RESPONSE TO THE AIRCRAFT. COCKPIT AUDIO AND IMAGERY COULD HAVE PROVIDED INSIGHT INTO WHEN THE CREWMEMBERS FIRST FELT OR DETECTED THE 6-HZ VIBRATION, HOW THEY MAY HAVE VERBALIZED THEIR ASSESSMENT OF AN OBSERVED ANOMALY, AND WHETHER THEY ATTEMPTED ANY SPECIFIC CORRECTIVE ACTION BECAUSE OF THE VIBRATION. THUS, THE LACK OF COCKPIT AUDIO OR IMAGE DATA PRECLUDED ACCESS TO DATA NEEDED TO FULLY DETERMINE WHY THE CREW MAY HAVE MOMENTARILY STOPPED THE COLLECTIVE PITCH REDUCTION TO RECOVER NR AND ANY CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THE CREW MAY HAVE ATTEMPTED AS A RESULT OF THE 6-HZ VIBRATION. 

REGARDLESS OF WHY THE CREW STOPPED RECOVERY OF NR AT 92%, OTHER HELICOPTER TEST PILOTS SUGGESTED IN POSTACCIDENT INTERVIEWS THAT CONTINUOUS FLIGHT IN THE 92% TO 93% NR RANGE WAS NOT ABNORMAL FOR AN OEI MANEUVER (IN THIS MODEL HELICOPTER AND ANOTHER MODEL IN THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER'S TEST PROGRAM). THIS IS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY ANOTHER MODEL IN THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER'S TEST PROGRAM DURING WHICH EXTENDED FLIGHT OCCURRED IN THE LOW 90% NR RANGE. (THE OTHER HELICOPTER MODEL DID NOT ENCOUNTER ANY UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR [ROTOR MODE/VIBRATION] DURING THE TEST POINTS WITH THE EXTENDED RECOVERY TIME, AND THE PILOTS DID NOT RECEIVE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK ON THE RECOVERY TIME.) THE LACK OF ANY NEGATIVE FEEDBACK ON EXTENDED FLIGHT IN THE LOW 90% NR RANGE MAY HAVE REINFORCED THAT FLIGHT THROUGH THAT RANGE WAS APPROPRIATE. ON THE PILOT DISPLAYS (SPECIFICALLY, THE POWER SITUATION INDICATOR [PSI]) IN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER MODEL, 90% TO 100% NR IS DEPICTED AS A GREEN RANGE OR ARC. THE DECISION TO FLY CONTINUOUSLY IN THE 92% TO 93% NR RANGE IS CONSISTENT WITH TYPICAL PILOT ASSOCIATION OF GREEN ARCS WITH FLIGHT REGIMES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR CONTINUOUS FLIGHT. THE COMPANY'S FLIGHT TECHNOLOGY SPECIALIST STATED THAT THE COLORS (GREEN ARC) PRESENTED ON THE PSI WERE A PRECEDENT TAKEN FROM THE OTHER HELICOPTER MODEL TEST PROGRAM, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT IT WAS LIKELY NOT REEVALUATED FOR APPROPRIATENESS GIVEN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER'S OPERATING LIMITATIONS. IN ADDITION, FLIGHT TESTING WAS ONLY CONDUCTED FOR CONTINUOUS FLIGHT AT 103% AND 100% NR WITH ALL ENGINES OPERATIVE; HOWEVER, NO TESTING OF NR CONTINUOUSLY BETWEEN 90% TO 100% WHILE IN AN OEI CONDITION WAS CONDUCTED. EXTENDED FLIGHT IN THE LOW 90% NR RANGE DURING PREVIOUS TESTING OF ANOTHER HELICOPTER MODEL AND THE DEPICTION OF 90% TO 100% NR IN A GREEN ARC ON THE PSI MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE PILOTS' DECISION TO STOP IN THE 92% RANGE DURING THE RECOVERY FROM THE OEI MANEUVER, WHICH RESULTED IN THE ONSET AND INCREASE OF THE 6-HZ VIBRATION. 

CREW RESPONSE TO LOW NR AND VIBRATION

INTERVIEWS WITH THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER TEST PILOTS AND ENGINEERS SUGGEST THAT THERE WERE TWO WAYS FOR THE PILOTS TO EXIT THE LOW NR AND, CORRESPONDINGLY, THE VIBRATION CONDITION: (1) LOWER/REDUCE THE COLLECTIVE TO INCREASE NR OR (2) EXIT OEI TRAINING MODE, WHICH WOULD INCREASE POWER AVAILABLE FROM THE ENGINES. ABOUT 1.5 TO 2 SECONDS PASSED BETWEEN THE STOP AT 58% COLLECTIVE AND THE ONSET OF THE VIBRATION. HAD THE PILOTS RECOVERED NR TO 100%, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE MAIN ROTOR SCISSORS MODE WOULD HAVE SUBSIDED AND THE AIRFRAME VIBRATIONS WOULD HAVE DAMPENED.

LOWERING THE COLLECTIVE

ONE OPTION FOR RECOVERING FROM THE LOW NR AND VIBRATION CONDITION WAS TO LOWER THE COLLECTIVE TO INCREASE NR. THE INVESTIGATION COULD NOT DETERMINE IF THE PILOTS' FLUCTUATING COLLECTIVE INPUTS WERE DELIBERATE WHEN THE 6-HZ VIBRATION WAS DOMINANT. BECAUSE THE CREW NEEDED TO BE AWARE OF LOW NR TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY, INVESTIGATORS CONSIDERED THE AVAILABLE VISUAL, AURAL, AND TACTILE CUES REGARDING NR IN THE VIBRATION ENVIRONMENT.

THE VISUAL CUES AVAILABLE TO THE CREW INCLUDED THE CREW ALERTING SYSTEM (CAS) TEXT ""ROTOR RPM LO,"" PSI NUMERIC DISPLAY, WARNING FLAG, WARNING PUSH BUTTON ANNUNCIATOR (PBA), AND THE CHANGE OF THE PSI NR DISPLAY FROM A BAR TO AN ARC. THE CAS TEXT, WARNING FLAG, AND WARNING PBA WOULD HAVE BEEN FLASHING UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE CREW. BECAUSE THE TELEMETRY DID NOT RECORD CREW BUTTON PRESSES, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO KNOW IF THE CREW ACKNOWLEDGED THESE ALERTS. STUDIES INDICATE THAT VISUAL ACUITY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY VERTICAL VIBRATION, PARTICULARLY IN THE 5- TO 7-HZ FREQUENCY RANGE (LEWIS AND GRIFFIN 1980A; LEWIS AND GRIFFIN 1980B). RESULTS INDICATED THAT READING SPEED AND ACCURACY DEGRADED FOR AMPLITUDES AS LOW AS 0.1 G (MCLEOD AND GRIFFIN 1989; GRIFFIN AND HAYWARD 1994). FURTHER STUDIES SHOW THAT VISUAL PERFORMANCE DECREASES WITH INCREASING VIBRATION AMPLITUDE (SHOENBERGER 1972; GRIFFIN 1975; GRIFFIN 2012). 

THE VERTICAL VIBRATION AMPLITUDE AT THE PILOT SEAT ROSE ABOVE 1 G FROM 10 SECONDS INTO THE TEST UNTIL THE END OF THE TEST, WITH PEAKS AS HIGH AS ABOUT 3 G. GIVEN THE SENSITIVITY OF THE HUMAN BODY TO VIBRATION FREQUENCIES NEAR 6 HZ AND THE EXTREME AMPLITUDE OF THE VIBRATION ENVIRONMENT, THE DISPLAYS WERE LIKELY UNREADABLE TO THE CREW (ALTHOUGH THE COLORS OF THE WARNING TEXT, FLAG, AND PBA MAY HAVE BEEN DISCERNABLE). IN ADDITION, THE CHANGE OF THE NR DISPLAY ON THE PSI FROM BAR TO ARC MAY HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZABLE; HOWEVER, READING OF THE NEEDLE WOULD LIKELY NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IN THE VIBRATION ENVIRONMENT. THUS, THE CREW WAS LIKELY UNABLE TO READ VISUAL INFORMATION THAT PROVIDED SPECIFIC LOW NR INFORMATION, ALTHOUGH THEY MAY HAVE HAD A GENERALIZED CUE THAT NR WAS LOW.

AURAL CUES AVAILABLE TO THE CREW REGARDING LOW NR INCLUDED THE MASTER WARNING ANNUNCIATION AND THE SOUND OF DECREASING NR. THE MASTER WARNING AURAL TONE WOULD HAVE ANNUNCIATED AT 12.5 SECONDS AND 16.8 SECONDS (CONTINUING UNTIL ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE CREW). HOWEVER, THIS TONE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AT LEAST 21 OTHER WARNING MESSAGES AND WAS NOT UNIQUE TO THE ""ROTOR RPM LO"" MESSAGE DESPITE A TECHNICAL STANDARD THAT REQUIRES THAT LOW NR HAVE A UNIQUE TONE ASSOCIATED WITH IT. THE MASTER AURAL TONE ANNUNCIATING CONTINUOUSLY WAS CHOSEN FOR TEST FLIGHT BECAUSE AUDIO FILES HAD NOT YET BEEN DEVELOPED; THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER PILOTS AND TEST TEAM HAD DECIDED THAT SOME AURAL ANNUNCIATION OF LOW NR WOULD BE ENOUGH TO PROCEED WITH TEST FLIGHTS BUT THAT THE DISTINCT TONE FOR LOW NR WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY NEEDED FOR FLIGHT TEST. 

AURAL CUES CAN BE USED FOR REDUNDANCY IF VISUAL INFORMATION IS UNAVAILABLE. THE ACCIDENT PILOTS WERE AWARE THAT A UNIQUE TONE DID NOT EXIST FOR LOW NR; HOWEVER, THEY LIKELY WERE NOT ABLE TO RETRIEVE UNAMBIGUOUS VISUAL INFORMATION TO CONFIRM THE WARNING, OUTSIDE OF A CHANGE IN SHAPE OF THE RPM DISPLAY. HAD A UNIQUE AURAL WARNING TONE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN THE HELICOPTER, IT COULD HAVE PROVIDED A SALIENT, UNAMBIGUOUS CUE TO THE CREWMEMBERS THAT","A SEVERE VIBRATION OF THE HELICOPTER THAT LED TO THE CREW'S INABILITY TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT ROTOR ROTATION SPEED (NR), LEADING TO EXCESSIVE MAIN ROTOR BLADE FLAPPING, SUBSEQUENT MAIN ROTOR BLADE CONTACT WITH THE TAIL BOOM, AND THE RESULTANT IN-FLIGHT BREAKUP. CONTRIBUTING TO THE SEVERITY AND SUSTAINMENT OF THE VIBRATION, WHICH WAS NOT PREDICTED DURING DEVELOPMENT, WERE (1) THE COLLECTIVE BIOMECHANICAL FEEDBACK AND (2) THE ATTITUDE AND HEADING REFERENCE SYSTEM RESPONSE, BOTH OF WHICH OCCURRED DUE TO THE LACK OF PROTECTIONS IN THE FLIGHT CONTROL LAWS AGAINST THE SUSTAINMENT AND GROWTH OF ADVERSE FEEDBACK LOOPS WHEN THE 6-HERTZ AIRFRAME VIBRATION INITIATED. CONTRIBUTING TO THE CREW'S INABILITY TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT NR IN THE SEVERE VIBRATION ENVIRONMENT WERE (1) THE LACK OF AN AUTOMATED SAFEGUARD IN THE MODIFIED ONE-ENGINE-INOPERATIVE SOFTWARE USED DURING FLIGHT TESTING TO EXIT AT A CRITICAL NR THRESHOLD AND (2) THE LACK OF DISTINCT AND UNAMBIGUOUS CUES FOR LOW NR."

ON OCTOBER 6, 2016, ABOUT 1645 CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME, A FAIRCHILD HILLER FH-1100 HELICOPTER, N4035G, WAS DESTROYED WHEN IT IMPACTED THE GROUND NEAR LINO LAKES, MINNESOTA, FOLLOWING AN IN-FLIGHT SEPARATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR ASSEMBLY. THE AIRLINE TRANSPORT PILOT AND PASSENGER SUSTAINED FATAL INJURIES, AND THE HELICOPTER WAS DESTROYED.  THE HELICOPTER WAS REGISTERED TO HELICOPTER CONNECTION LLC, AND OPERATED BY THE PILOT UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS PART 91 AS PERSONAL FLIGHT. DAY VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED, AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE LOCAL FLIGHT, WHICH ORIGINATED FROM THE ANOKA COUNTY-BLAINE AIRPORT (ANE), NEAR MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA, ABOUT 1620.

ACCORDING TO A PILOT-RATED PASSENGER WHO HAD FLOWN WITH THE ACCIDENT PILOT IN THE HELICOPTER EARLIER IN THE DAY, THE ACCIDENT PILOT HAD NOT FLOWN THE HELICOPTER FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND WANTED THE PASSENGER TO ""RIDE ALONG"" AS A SAFETY PILOT. BOTH THE PILOT AND PASSENGER PERFORMED A PREFLIGHT INSPECTION OF THE HELICOPTER, WHICH REVEALED NO ANOMALIES. ABOUT 1000, THEY DEPARTED ON A 5-MINUTE FLIGHT THEN RETURNED AND WENT TO LUNCH. AFTER LUNCH, THEY DEPARTED ON A LOCAL FLIGHT, WHICH LASTED ABOUT 45 MINUTES. AFTER THE FLIGHT, THE PASSENGER ASKED THE PILOT IF HE WANTED HELP MOVING THE HELICOPTER INTO THE HANGAR, AND THE PILOT INDICATED THAT HE MAY FLY THE HELICOPTER LATER.

LATER THAT DAY, SEVERAL WITNESSES SAW THE HELICOPTER FLYING IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION. ONE WITNESS STATED THAT HE OBSERVED THE HELICOPTER ROCKING BACK AND FORTH BEFORE IT ""SPUN SIDEWAYS"" AND ""A BUNCH OF PARTS"" DEPARTED THE HELICOPTER. SOME REPORTED HEARING A ""CLUNK"" SOUND, AND OTHERS REPORTED HEARING A ""POP"" SOUND. ONE WITNESS SAW THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES ""SEIZE,"" THEN ""SNAP OFF,"" FOLLOWED BY THE TAIL ROTOR DEPARTING THE HELICOPTER. THE WITNESS STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER THEN ""DROPPED OUT OF THE SKY."" SEVERAL OF THE WITNESSES SAW PARTS DEPARTING THE HELICOPTER AS IT DESCENDED TO GROUND CONTACT.


PERSONNEL INFORMATION

THE 48-YEAR-OLD PILOT HELD AN AIRLINE TRANSPORT PILOT CERTIFICATE WITH AN AIRPLANE MULTI-ENGINE LAND RATING. HE HELD COMMERCIAL PILOT PRIVILEGES IN AIRPLANE SINGLE ENGINE LAND, AIRPLANE SINGLE ENGINE SEA, AND ROTORCRAFT-HELICOPTER. THE PILOT ALSO HELD A FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR CERTIFICATE WITH AIRPLANE SINGLE- AND MULTI-ENGINE AND INSTRUMENT AIRPLANE RATINGS. HE HELD A FLIGHT ENGINEER CERTIFICATE WITH A TURBOJET RATING. THE PILOT HELD A FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) SPECIAL ISSUANCE FIRST CLASS MEDICAL CERTIFICATE, DATED AUGUST 16, 2016, WITH LIMITATIONS FOR CORRECTIVE LENSES AND NOT VALID FOR ANY CLASS AFTER FEBRUARY 28, 2017. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE HAD ACCUMULATED 15,000 TOTAL HOURS OF FLIGHT TIME AND 400 HOURS OF FLIGHT TIME DURING THE SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE MEDICAL EXAM. THE LAST ENTRY IN THE PILOT'S LOGBOOK WAS DATED SEPTEMBER 4, 2015, WHICH WAS THE DATE HE PASSED HIS COMMERCIAL ROTORCRAFT-HELICOPTER CHECKRIDE. THE PILOT ACCUMULATED 55.5 HOURS OF TOTAL FLIGHT EXPERIENCE IN HELICOPTERS AT THE TIME OF THAT ENTRY, OF WHICH ABOUT 38 HOURS WERE IN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER MAKE AND MODEL.

THE PILOT'S HELICOPTER FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR REPORTED THAT, FROM APRIL 15, 2015, TO AUGUST 4, 2015, HE PROVIDED INSTRUCTION TO THE PILOT IN THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER TO PREPARE HIM FOR HIS CHECKRIDE TO OBTAIN A ROTORCRAFT-HELICOPTER RATING. THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR STATED THAT THE PILOT HAD SOME TROUBLE AT FIRST IN THE TRANSITION FROM FIXED WING TO HELICOPTER AND THAT THIS IS FAIRLY COMMON FOR HIGH-TIME FIXED-WING PILOTS, SUCH AS THE ACCIDENT PILOT. AFTER SOME TIME, THE ACCIDENT PILOT SEEMED TO HANDLE THE TRANSITION AS WELL AS ANY OTHER OF HIS STUDENTS THAT HAD PREVIOUS FIXED-WING TIME.

THE INSTRUCTOR STATED THAT HE GAVE THE PILOT GROUND INSTRUCTION ON TEETERING ROTOR SYSTEMS. WHEN ASKED HOW THE PILOT RESPONDED DURING TRAINING SITUATIONS THAT COULD PRECIPITATE MAST BUMPING, THE INSTRUCTOR STATED THAT THE PILOT RESPONDED CORRECTLY TO FLIGHT IN TURBULENT CONDITIONS. HE ADDED THAT, DURING POWER LOSS SIMULATIONS, THE PILOT INITIALLY WAS SLOW TO LOWER THE COLLECTIVE AND WOULD ALLOW THE NOSE TO DROP. EVENTUALLY, THE PILOT DEMONSTRATED PROPER ENTRY INTO AND PROFICIENCY IN AUTOROTATIONS.

THE PILOT'S HELICOPTER FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR REPORTED THAT ALL THE INSTRUCTION HE PROVIDED TO THE PILOT TOOK PLACE NEAR LAKE CHARLES, LOUISIANA, AND, AFTER PASSING HIS ROTORCRAFT-HELICOPTER CHECKRIDE, THE PILOT TRAILERED THE HELICOPTER TO THE MINNEAPOLIS AREA. DURING THE TRIP, ONE OF THE DOORS OF THE HELICOPTER CAME OPEN AND CRACKED THE WINDSHIELD OF THE HELICOPTER. ACCORDING TO THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR, THE PILOT HAD JUST COMPLETED REPLACEMENT OF THE WINDSHIELD A SHORT TIME BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.


AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER WAS ISSUED AN FAA STANDARD AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATE ON OCTOBER 20, 1982, AND WAS CERTIFICATED FOR NORMAL CATEGORY OPERATIONS. THE ALLISON (ROLLS ROYCE) MODEL M250-C20B ENGINE POWERED A TWO-BLADED, TEETERING MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM. THE ENGINE MANUFACTURER INDICATED THAT THE RATED HORSEPOWER FOR THE M250-C20B ENGINE IS 420 SHAFT HORSEPOWER. ACCORDING TO THE HELICOPTER'S TYPE CERTIFICATE DATA SHEET, THE ENGINE HAD A TAKEOFF POWER RATING OF 274 SHAFT HORSEPOWER (HP) FOR A MAXIMUM OF 5 MINUTES, AND A MAXIMUM CONTINUOUS POWER RATING OF 233 SHAFT HP. THE HELICOPTER HAD A MAXIMUM GROSS WEIGHT OF 2,750 LBS AND COULD BE CONFIGURED TO ACCOMMODATE A PILOT, ANOTHER PILOT OR PASSENGER IN THE COCKPIT, AND THREE PASSENGERS IN THE CABIN. THE HELICOPTER'S FLIGHT MANUAL HAD LIMITATIONS TO PROHIBIT ACROBATIC FLIGHT AND TO AVOID ABRUPT CONTROL MOVEMENTS WHEN FLYING IN TURBULENCE. THE HELICOPTER'S MOST RECENT ANNUAL INSPECTION WAS COMPLETED ON JUNE 18, 2015, AT A TOTAL TIME IN SERVICE OF 501.7 HOURS.

IN JANUARY 2004, THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER ISSUED ALERT SERVICE LETTER 23 - 5. THE LETTER INDICATED THAT SEVERAL INSTANCES OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL MAST CORROSION HAD BEEN DISCOVERED EVEN WHEN THE MAST WAS PROPERLY SEALED. THE CORRECTIVE ACTION WAS TO REMOVE THE TRANSMISSION TOP CASE, WITH THE MAST ATTACHED, AND SHIP THE ASSEMBLY TO THE FACTORY FOR NON-DESTRUCTIVE INSPECTIONS. A SPECIAL COATING WAS TO BE APPLIED ON THE INTERIOR SURFACES. THIS PROCESS IS ONLY APPROVED AT THE FACTORY AND CANNOT BE PERFORMED IN THE FIELD. SUBSEQUENT TO THE INITIAL INSPECTION, THIS PROCESS MUST BE DONE AT EACH OVERHAUL OF THE TRANSMISSION OR EVERY 10 YEARS WHICHEVER COMES FIRST.


METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

AT 1645, THE RECORDED WEATHER AT ANE, ABOUT 4 MILES SOUTHWEST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, INCLUDED WIND FROM 010° AT 6 KNOTS, VISIBILITY 10 STATUTE MILES, OVERCAST CLOUDS AT 6,000 FEET; TEMPERATURE 15°C, DEW POINT 6°C, AND AN ALTIMETER OF 29.95 INCHES OF MERCURY.


WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE MAIN WRECKAGE CAME TO REST ON ITS RIGHT SIDE ABOUT 4 NAUTICAL MILES AND 52° MAGNETIC FROM ANE, ON A HEADING ABOUT 20° MAGNETIC. THE AREA AROUND THE MAIN WRECKAGE WAS DISCOLORED AND CHARRED, CONSISTENT WITH A POSTACCIDENT GROUND FIRE. THE REMAINING SECTIONS OF WRECKAGE DID NOT EXHIBIT ANY EVIDENCE OF PRE- OR POSTIMPACT FIRE.

THE INITIAL PIECE OF WRECKAGE WAS A SECTION OF COMPOSITE MATERIAL LOCATED ABOUT 1,675 FT SOUTH OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE. A DEBRIS PATH EXTENDED TO THE MAIN WRECKAGE AND CONTAINED THE FLOOR MATS, A SECTION OF WHITE INTERIOR MATERIAL, AN EXHAUST STACK, EXHAUST DUCT, A SECTION OF THE TAILBOOM, THE ENGINE COWL, A SECTION OF EXTERIOR METAL WITH THE ROTATING BEACON, A SEAT CUSHION, AND A SECTION OF THE TAIL, INCLUDING THE TAIL ROTOR AND ITS GEARBOX. THE SEPARATED MAIN ROTOR BLADES AND HUB WERE FOUND EAST OF THIS DEBRIS PATH IN A POND ABOUT 500 FT SOUTH OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE. ALL MAJOR COMPONENTS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AT THE SCENE.

THE MAIN WRECKAGE, CONSISTING OF THE COCKPIT AND CABIN, WAS DESTROYED BY IMPACT AND POSTIMPACT FIRE. CYCLIC, COLLECTIVE, AND TAIL ROTOR CONTROL CONTINUITY COULD NOT BE ESTABLISHED DUE TO SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE TO THE COCKPIT AND CABIN AREAS. HOWEVER, ALL OBSERVED CONTROL DISCONTINUITIES WERE CONSISTENT WITH OVERLOAD OR THERMAL DAMAGE.

THE ENGINE, TRANSMISSION, AND TAIL ROTOR DRIVESHAFTS EXHIBITED SEPARATIONS. ALL OBSERVED SEPARATIONS WERE CONSISTENT WITH TORSIONAL OVERLOAD AND OVERLOAD. CIRCUMFERENTIAL WITNESS MARKS WERE OBSERVED ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVESHAFT.

THE MAIN TRANSMISSION EXHIBITED SECTIONS WITH THERMAL MELTING DAMAGE, SOOT-COLORED DISCOLORATION, AND DEFORMATION. THE SEPARATION SURFACE AT THE TOP OF THE MAST EXHIBITED OVERLOAD FRACTURES. THE MAST COULD NOT BE ROTATED BY HAND.

THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES AND HUB EXHIBITED OVERLOAD FRACTURES ON THE SEPARATION SURFACE. EXAMINATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM AND COMPONENTS FOUND OUTSIDE THE MAIN WRECKAGE SITE DID NOT EXHIBIT SOOT COLORED DISCOLORATION OR THERMAL DAMAGE.

EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED THAT SEVERAL COMPRESSOR BLADES WERE MISSING. THE REMAINING COMPRESSOR BLADES WERE FOUND BENT OPPOSITE THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION.

A SECTION OF THE TRANSMISSION'S MAIN ROTOR MAST AND THE SECTION OF MAST FROM THE MAIN ROTOR HUB WERE REMOVED AND WERE SENT TO THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) MATERIALS LABORATORY FOR DETAILED EXAMINATION.


MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

AN ANOKA COUNTY CORONER ARRANGED FOR THE MIDWEST MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE, RAMSEY, MINNESOTA, TO CONDUCT AN AUTOPSY ON THE PILOT. TOXICOLOGICAL SAMPLES WERE TAKEN DURING THE AUTOPSY. THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS LISTED AS MULTIPLE BLUNT FORCE INJURIES AND THE MANNER OF DEATH WAS INDICATED AS AN ACCIDENT.

THE FAA BIOAERONAUTICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH LABORATORY, OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, PERFORMED TOXICOLOGY TESTING ON THE PILOT. TESTING WAS NEGATIVE FOR CARBON MONOXIDE, ETHANOL, AND ALL TESTED-FOR DRUGS.


TESTS AND RESEARCH

THE RETAINED SECTIONS OF ROTOR MAST WERE EXAMINED BY THE NTSB MATERIALS LABORATORY. THE MAST SHOWED DEFORMATION AND FRACTURES ON SLANT ANGLES CONSISTENT WITH AN OVERSTRESS FRACTURE UNDER BENDING AND TORSION LOADS. DEFORMATION TO THE MAST ASSOCIATED WITH IMPACT MARKS ADJACENT TO THE FRACTURE WERE CONSISTENT WITH MAST BUMPING. NO EVIDENCE OF PREEXISTING CRACKS OR CORROSION WAS OBSERVED.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

THE NTSB DATABASE WAS QUERIED FOR PREVIOUS MAST BUMPING ACCIDENTS WITH FAIRCHILD-HILLER FH 1100 HELICOPTERS. THE FTW68A0085, NYC83FA102, LAX83FA362, IAD98FA049, AND DFW07FA198 INVESTIGATIONS LISTED OCCURRENCES OF MAST BUMPING FINDINGS AND THEIR REPORTS ARE APPENDED TO THE DOCKET MATERIAL ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INVESTIGATION.

THE NTSB DATABASE ALSO CONTAINED THE CHI00FA266 INVESTIGATION. INTERNAL CORROSION WAS OBSERVED WITHIN THE MAIN ROTOR MAST ON THAT HELICOPTER. THIS PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION REPORT IS ALSO APPENDED TO THE DOCKET MATERIAL ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INVESTIGATION.

THE FAA HELICOPTER FLYING HANDBOOK (FAA-H-8083-21A), IN PART, STATED:

LOW-G CONDITIONS AND MAST BUMPING
LOW ACCELERATION OF GRAVITY (LOW-G OR WEIGHTLESS) MANEUVERS CREATE SPECIFIC HAZARDS FOR HELICOPTERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH SEMIRIGID MAIN ROTOR SYSTEMS BECAUSE HELICOPTERS ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO BE SUSPENDED FROM THE MAIN ROTOR IN NORMAL FLIGHT WITH ONLY SMALL VARIATIONS FOR POSITIVE G LOAD MANEUVERS. SINCE A HELICOPTER LOW-G MANEUVER DEPARTS FROM NORMAL FLIGHT CONDITIONS, IT MAY ALLOW THE AIRFRAME TO EXCEED THE MANUFACTURER'S DESIGN CRITERIA. A LOW-G CONDITION COULD HAVE DISASTROUS RESULTS, THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING IS TO AVOID THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH IT MIGHT OCCUR.

LOW-G CONDITIONS ARE NOT ABOUT THE LOSS OF THRUST, RATHER THE IMBALANCE OF FORCES. HELICOPTERS ARE MOSTLY DESIGNED TO HAVE WEIGHT (GRAVITY PULLING DOWN TO THE EARTH) AND LIFT OPPOSING THAT FORCE OF GRAVITY. LOW-G MANEUVERS OCCUR WHEN THIS BALANCE IS DISTURBED. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE PLACING THE HELICOPTER INTO A VERY STEEP DIVE. AT THE MOMENT OF PUSHOVER, THE LIFT AND THRUST OF THE ROTOR IS FORWARD, WHEREAS GRAVITY IS NOW VERTICAL OR STRAIGHT DOWN. SINCE THE LIFT VECTOR IS NO LONGER VERTICAL AND OPPOSING THE GRAVITY (OR WEIGHT) VECTOR, THE FUSELAGE IS NOW AFFECTED BY THE TAIL ROTOR THRUST BELOW THE PLANE OF THE MAIN ROTOR. THIS TAIL ROTOR THRUST MOMENT TENDS TO MAKE THE HELICOPTER FUSELAGE TILT TO THE LEFT. PILOTS THEN APPLY RIGHT CYCLIC INPUTS TO TRY TO CORRECT FOR THE LEFT. SINCE THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM DOES NOT FULLY SUPPORT THE FUSELAGE AT THIS POINT, THE FUSELAGE CONTINUES TO ROLL AND THE PILOT APPLIES MORE RIGHT CYCLIC UNTIL THE ROTOR SYSTEM STRIKES THE MAST (MAST BUMPING), OFTEN ENDING WITH UNNECESSARY FATAL RESULTS. IN MAST BUMPING, THE ROTOR BLADE EXCEEDS ITS FLAPPING LIMITS, CAUSING THE MAIN ROTOR HUB TO ""BUMP"" INTO THE ROTOR SHAFT. THE MAIN ROTOR HUB'S CONTACT WITH THE MAST USUALLY BECOMES MORE VIOLENT WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE FLAPPING MOTION. THIS CREATES A GREATER FLAPPING DISPLACEMENT AND LEADS TO STRUCTURAL FAILURE OF THE ROTOR SHAFT. SINCE THE MAST IS HOLLOW, THE STRUCTURAL FAILURE MANIFESTS ITSELF EITHER AS SHAFT FAILURE WITH COMPLETE SEPARATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR SYSTEM FROM THE HELICOPTER OR A SEVERELY DAMAGED ROTOR MAST.

IN SITUATIONS LIKE THE ONE DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE HELICOPTER PILOT SHOULD FIRST APPLY AFT CYCLIC TO BRING THE VECTORS INTO BALANCE, WITH LIFT UP AND GRAVITY DOWN. SINCE HELICOPTER BLADES CARRY THE HELICOPTER AND HAVE LIMITED MOTION ATTACHMENT, CARE MUST BE GIVEN TO THOSE ATTACHMENT LIMITS. HELICOPTER PILOTS SHOULD ALWAYS ADHERE TO THE MANEUVERING LIMITATIONS STATED IN THE [ROTORCRAFT FLIGHT MANUAL]. THERE MAY BE MORE THAN ONE REASON OR DESIGN CRITERIA WHICH LIMITS THE HELICOPTER'S FLIGHT ENVELOPE. HEED ALL OF THE MANUFACTURER'S LIMITATIONS AND ADVISORY DATA. FAILURE TO DO SO COULD LEAD TO DIRE, UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.","THE AIRLINE TRANSPORT PILOT WAS CONDUCTING A LOCAL FLIGHT WITH ONE PASSENGER. THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT WAS THE PILOT'S THIRD FLIGHT IN THE HELICOPTER ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT; BEFORE THAT DAY, HE HAD NOT FLOWN THE HELICOPTER IN NEARLY ONE YEAR.  ONE WITNESS STATED THAT HE SAW THE HELICOPTER ROCKING BACK AND FORTH BEFORE IT ""SPUN SIDEWAYS"" AND ""A BUNCH OF PARTS"" DEPARTED THE AIRFRAME. SOME REPORTED HEARING A ""CLUNK"" SOUND, AND OTHERS REPORTED HEARING A ""POP"" SOUND. ANOTHER WITNESS SAW THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES ""SEIZE,"" THEN ""SNAP OFF,"" FOLLOWED BY THE TAIL ROTOR DEPARTING THE HELICOPTER. THE WITNESS STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER THEN ""DROPPED OUT OF THE SKY."" THE FUSELAGE IMPACTED IN AN OPEN FIELD, AND A POSTCRASH FIRE ERUPTED. THE SEPARATED MAIN ROTOR BLADES AND HUB WERE FOUND IN A POND ABOUT 500 FT SOUTH OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.

EXAMINATION OF THE ROTOR MAST SHOWED DEFORMATION AND FRACTURES CONSISTENT WITH OVERSTRESS UNDER BENDING AND TORSION LOADS BUT NO EVIDENCE OF PREEXISTING CRACKS OR CORROSION. THE OBSERVED DEFORMATION OF THE MAST WAS CONSISTENT WITH A MAST BUMPING EVENT. MAST BUMPING CAN OCCUR IN LOW ACCELERATION OF GRAVITY (G) FLIGHT CONDITIONS, CAUSING THE ROTOR BLADE TO EXCEED ITS FLAPPING LIMITS AND RESULTING IN THE MAIN ROTOR HUB BUMPING INTO THE ROTOR SHAFT. THIS OFTEN RESULTS IN STRUCTURAL FAILURE OF THE ROTOR SHAFT AND A SUBSEQUENT SEPARATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR.

DUE TO THE EXTENSIVE THERMAL DAMAGE TO THE WRECKAGE, ONLY A LIMITED EXAMINATION COULD BE CONDUCTED; HOWEVER, NO MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS OR ANOMALIES WERE NOTED THAT WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED NORMAL OPERATION.

THE PILOT HAD ACCUMULATED ABOUT 15,000 FLIGHT HOURS IN AIRPLANES BUT ONLY HAD ABOUT 55 HOURS FLIGHT TIME IN HELICOPTERS, MOST OF WHICH WERE ACCUMULATED MORE THAN 1 YEAR BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. ALTHOUGH THE PILOT HAD RECEIVED INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO AVOID MAST BUMPING, GIVEN HIS LOW HELICOPTER EXPERIENCE RELATIVE TO HIS AIRPLANE EXPERIENCE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE MADE A LARGE, ABRUPT FLIGHT CONTROL INPUT THAT RESULTED IN A LOW-G FLIGHT CONDITION AND LED TO THE OBSERVED MAST BUMPING. HOWEVER, THE PILOT'S CONTROL INPUTS ARE UNKNOWN, AND THE INITIATING EVENT FOR THE MAST BUMPING COULD NOT BE DETERMINED.",THE SEPARATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR ASSEMBLY DUE TO MAST BUMPING.

ON FEBRUARY 6, 2017, AT 1906 CENTRAL STANDARD TIME, A BELL 206B-III, N978RH, IMPACTED THE WATERS OF WEST BAY NEAR GALVESTON, TEXAS. ONE PASSENGER WAS FATALLY INJURED. THE PILOT AND A SECOND PASSENGER WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED. THE HELICOPTER WAS DESTROYED. THE HELICOPTER WAS REGISTERED TO AND OPERATED BY REPUBLIC HELICOPTERS, SANTA FE, TEXAS, UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS (CFR) PART 135 AS A NON-SCHEDULED DOMESTIC PASSENGER FLIGHT. INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS (IMC) PREVAILED AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. COMPANY FLIGHT FOLLOWING WAS BEING UTILIZED. THE FLIGHT ORIGINATED FROM THE OIL TANKER EAGLE VANCOUVER, ANCHORED IN GALVESTON BAY, AT 1837, AND WAS EN ROUTE TO REPUBLIC'S HELICOPTERS, INC., HELIPORT (2TE1), SANTA FE, TEXAS.

ACCORDING TO THE OPERATOR, THIS WAS THE HELICOPTER'S THIRD FLIGHT OF THE DAY. IT DEPARTED 2TE1 AT 1404 AND FLEW TO THE EAGLE VANCOUVER, LANDING AT 1457. THE PILOT SHUT DOWN AND THE TWO PASSENGERS, BOTH EMPLOYEES OF SOCIETE GENERALDE SURVEILLANCE (SGS), DISEMBARKED AND BEGAN THEIR WORK ON THE TANKER. THE HELICOPTER HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN SCHEDULED TO DEPART AT 1600 BUT WAS DELAYED. THE HELICOPTER FINALLY TOOK OFF AT 1837. OFFICIAL SUNSET WAS AT 1802. IT WAS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE AT 2TE1 AT 1910. THE LAST RADIO COMMUNICATION REPUBLIC HELICOPTERS OPERATIONS HAD WITH THE HELICOPTER WAS AT 1906 WHEN THE PILOT REPORTED, ""I HAVE THE LIGHTS OF THE SHORE.""

THE HELICOPTER WAS EQUIPPED WITH A GPS SKYROUTER FAST TRACKING SYSTEM THAT REPORTS THE HELICOPTER'S POSITION EVERY 2 MINUTES. THE LAST DATA POINT RECEIVED FROM THE GPS SKYROUTER SYSTEM WAS AT 1906, WHEN THE HELICOPTER WAS ABOUT 0.27MILES FROM THE GALVESTON ISLAND COASTLINE AT 494 FEET AND 127 MPH. REPUBLIC HELICOPTERS AN ""INACTIVE"" SIGNAL WAS RECEIVED FROM THE BLUE SKY GPS BY REPUBLIC HELICOPTERS OPERATIONS 10 MINUTES AFTER THIS LAST CONTACT, OR 1916, AND THE U.S. COAST GUARD WAS ALERTED. BASED ON TIME AND DISTANCE FROM THE LAST DATA POINT TO THE ACCIDENT LOCATION WITH AN APPROXIMATE HELICOPTER SPEED OF 120 MPH, THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WAS COMPUTED TO BE 1909.

ON FEBRUARY 22, 2017, AT 1100, TWO FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION INSPECTORS FROM THE HOUSTON FLIGHT STANDARDS DISTRICT OFFICE INTERVIEWED THE PILOT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BRANCH IN GALVESTON. ALSO PRESENT WAS REPUBLIC'S DIRECTOR OF SAFETY AND THE PILOT'S WIFE. THE PILOT CONFIRMED THERE HAD BEEN A DELAY IN DEPARTURE, BUT WHEN THEY DID DEPART, THE WEATHER WAS ""GOOD."" HE SAID HE HAD MORE THAN 6 MILES' VISIBILITY AND HE COULD SEE THE MOON ABOVE AND THE WATER BELOW.  HE CONTACTED REPUBLIC OPERATIONS, ESTABLISHED HIS FLIGHT PLAN, RECEIVED A WEATHER UPDATE AND GOT THE CURRENT ALTIMETER SETTING. HIS EN ROUTE ALTITUDE WAS BETWEEN 700 AND 800 FEET. HE SAID THAT AS HE APPROACHED GALVESTON ISLAND STATE PARK, HE HAD VISUAL REFERENCE WITH THE LIGHTS FROM GALVESTON AND LIGHTS OFF THE WATER. THE NEXT THING HE REMEMBERED WAS BEING IN THE WATER.
HE DIDN'T. THEY HAD TO THROW THE LINE AGAIN. WHEN THEY GOT ME TO THE DECK, I JUST FLOPPED DOWN ON THE DECK. I WAS SO COLD. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT TOOK SO LONG FOR SOMEONE TO RESCUE US.""

THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS AT N29°14.39' W94°59.44' -- 4.3 MILES FROM THE LAST BLUE SKY DATA POINT AT AN AZIMUTH OF 326.95° AND 8 MILES, OR 283° FROM SCHOLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (KGLS), GALVESTON. IT WAS 6.96 MILES ON A HEADING OF 325.73° FROM 2TE1. THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS IN AN AREA WITH LITTLE OR NO GROUND LIGHTS.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

THE HELICOPTER WAS RECOVERED FROM WEST BAY ON FEBRUARY 8, 2017, BY T&T MARINE SALVAGE, INC, AND WAS EXAMINED AT THEIR FACILITIES AT TEICHMAN POINT, GALVESTON, ON FEBRUARY 8 AND 9, 2017. T&T MARINE SALVAGE REPORTED THE WATER DEPTH AT THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS APPROXIMATELY 7 TO 8 FEET, AND ALL RECOVERED WRECKAGE WAS FOUND IN A RADIUS OF 80 TO 100 FEET.

DAMAGE WAS CONSISTENT WITH A RELATIVELY LEVEL WATER IMPACT. THE FUSELAGE WAS SEPARATED INTO SEVERAL SECTIONS. THE CABIN AND COCKPIT AREA WAS EXTENSIVELY DAMAGED. THE MAIN ROTOR HAD DEPARTED THE HELICOPTER. THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF MAST BUMPING. THE MAST FRACTURE WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE ROTATING MAIN ROTOR BLADES STRIKING THE WATER. THREE MAIN ROTOR BLADES STRIKES TO THE FUSELAGE WERE NOTED. BOTH MAIN ROTOR BLADES BORE IMPACT DAMAGE, WITH ONE BLADE MISSING TWO-THIRDS OF ITS SPAN TO THE TIP.  THE OTHER MAIN ROTOR BLADES HAD AN INTACT SPAR, BUT THE SPAR WAS BENT FORWARD -- CONSISTENT WITH SUDDEN STOPPAGE. TRANSMISSION CONTINUITY WAS OBSERVED. THE LAST TWO TAIL ROTOR DRIVESHAFT SEGMENTS ON THE TAIL BOOM WERE MISSING AND EVIDENCE INDICATED THAT THE DRIVESHAFT WAS STRUCK BY A MAIN ROTOR BLADE AT IMPACT. THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX ROTATED FREELY.  THE HELICOPTER WAS EQUIPPED WITH STC (SUPPLEMENTAL TYPE CERTIFICATE) VAN HORN TAIL ROTOR BLADES. THEY TURNED FREELY , AND THE HUB AND BLADES WERE RELATIVELY INTACT. FREE T/R PITCH CHANGE WAS PRESENT THROUGH THE T/R HUB.  THE FLIGHT CONTROLS EXHIBITED MUCH DAMAGE IN THE COCKPIT AND VERTICAL TUNNEL AREAS. NO PRE-IMPACT ANOMALIES WERE OBSERVED IN ANY AIRFRAME SYSTEMS.

EXAMINATION OF THE INSTRUMENT PANEL REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: ALTIMETER, 900 FEET; KOLLSMAN WINDOW, 29.92 INCHES OF MERCURY; HEADING INDICATOR, 220°; HOBBS METER, 4,143.8. EXAMINATION OF THE ANNUNCIATOR PANEL REVEALED NO STRETCHING OF ANY OF THE BULB FILAMENTS. EXAMINATION OF THE POSITION LIGHTS REVEALED NO FILAMENT STRETCHING OF THE RED OR WHITE LIGHTS. THE GREEN LIGHT AND LANDING LIGHTS WERE DESTROYED.


MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

THE PILOT AND RIGHT REAR SEAT PASSENGER WERE BOTH SERIOUSLY INJURED AND WERE FOUND BY THE U.S. COAST GUARD APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR AFTER THE ACCIDENT, CLINGING TO A SECTION OF FUSELAGE.  THE PILOT HAD SUSTAINED STOMACH AND INTESTINAL TRAUMA, SEVERAL LUMBAR FRACTURES, AND ABRASIONS ON HIS SHOULDERS, CONSISTENT WITH RUBBING OF THE SHOULDER HARNESS. THE LEFT FRONT SEAT PASSENGER WAS FATALLY INJURED AND WAS FOUND ABOUT 100 METERS FROM THE WRECKAGE.","THE NON-SCHEDULED PASSENGER HELICOPTER FLIGHT DEPARTED FROM AN OIL TANKER SHIP THAT WAS ANCHORED IN A BAY. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN DELAYED, BUT, WHEN THE HELICOPTER DID DEPART, THE WEATHER WAS ""GOOD."" HE SAID HE HAD MORE THAN 6 MILES VISIBILITY, THAT AND HE COULD SEE THE MOON ABOVE AND THE WATER BELOW, AND THAT HIS EN ROUTE ALTITUDE WAS BETWEEN 700 AND 800 FEET. HE ADDED THAT AS THE FLIGHT APPROACHED THE SHORE AT 500 FEET, HE COULD SEE THE CITY LIGHTS AND LIGHTS OFF THE WATER. THE NEXT THING HE REMEMBERED WAS BEING IN THE WATER. HE AND THE TWO PASSENGERS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND BY THE US COAST GUARD ABOUT 1HOUR LATER. THE NEAREST WEATHER OBSERVATION STATION, LOCATED 8 MILES EAST OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, REPORTED AN OVERCAST CEILING OF 400 FEET AND 5 MILES VISIBILITY IN MIST ABOUT 17 MINUTES BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. TAFS AND AIRMETS ISSUED ABOUT 1.5 HOURS AND 1 HOUR BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, RESPECTIVELY, FORECAST INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS (IMC). POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER WRECKAGE WAS CONSISTENT WITH A RELATIVELY LEVEL IMPACT, AND NO PRE-IMPACT MECHANICAL ANOMALIES WERE NOTED THAT WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED NORMAL OPERATION. IT IS LIKELY THAT THE FLIGHT ENCOUNTERED IMC AT NIGHT AND THAT THE PILOT DID NOT PROPERLY GAUGE THE DISTANCE OF THE HELICOPTER FROM THE WATER, WHICH LED TO ITS COLLISION WITH THE WATER.","THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE THE FLIGHT HAD ENCOUNTERED INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AT NIGHT, WHICH RESULTED IN AN UNRECOGNIZED DESCENT AND COLLISION WITH WATER."
20170813X82426,1,BELL,407,ERA17FA274,2017,08/12/17 00:00:00,CHARLOTTESVILLE,VA,USA,2.0,True,1.0,BELL,407,32.0,BELL 407,"ON AUGUST 12, 2017, ABOUT 1649 EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME, A BELL 407, N31VA, OPERATED BY THE VIRGINIA STATE POLICE (VSP), WAS DESTROYED AFTER IMPACTING TREES AND TERRAIN IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA. THE AIRLINE TRANSPORT RATED PILOT, AND PRIVATE PILOT-RATED OBSERVER, WERE FATALLY INJURED. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED, AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE PUBLIC USE AERIAL OBSERVATION FLIGHT THAT DEPARTED CHARLOTTESVILLE-ALBEMARLE AIRPORT (CHO), CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA ABOUT 1554.

ACCORDING TO THE VSP, THE MISSION OF THE HELICOPTER FLIGHT CREW WAS TO PROVIDE CONTINUOUS VIDEO DOWNLINK TO THE VSP COMMAND CENTER OF THE PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS THAT WERE OCCURRING IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA. AFTER BEING REFUELED, THE HELICOPTER DEPARTED CHO ABOUT 1554, WITH THE AIRLINE TRANSPORT PILOT FLYING THE HELICOPTER, AND OBSERVER OPERATING THE HELICOPTER'S CAMERA.

THE HELICOPTER ARRIVED OVER THE CITY OF CHARLOTTESVILLE AT 1604, AND REMAINED OVER THE CITY UNTIL 1642 WHEN THEY WERE RE-TASKED TO PROVIDE OVER-WATCH FOR THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA'S MOTORCADE. AT 1643, THE HELICOPTER CREW ADVISED THE VSP COMMAND CENTER THAT THEY WERE HEADING DIRECTLY TO THE MOTORCADE, AND WERE ABOUT 30 SECONDS AWAY. ABOUT 1649, ANOTHER HELICOPTER ADVISED THE VSP COMMAND CENTER THAT THE ACCIDENT HELICOPTER HAD CRASHED.

PRELIMINARY RADAR DATA PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA), INDICATED THAT JUST PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT, AT 1648, THE HELICOPTER WAS FLYING AT AN ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 2,200 FT ABOVE MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL) IN THE AREA OF THE MOTORCADE. AT THAT TIME, THE HELICOPTER WAS TRAVELING NORTH-NORTHWESTBOUND BEFORE IT BEGAN TO TURN TO THE RIGHT AND DESCEND RAPIDLY. AT 1648:30, RADAR INDICATED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS DESCENDING THROUGH 1,450 FT MSL, AT A CALCULATED GROUNDSPEED OF 30 KNOTS. MOMENTS LATER, THE HELICOPTER DESCENDED BELOW THE FLOOR OF RADAR COVERAGE, AND RADAR CONTACT WAS LOST.

APPROXIMATELY 37 WITNESSES WERE INTERVIEWED, AND THEIR DESCRIPTIONS OF THE ALTITUDE, DIRECTION OF FLIGHT, AND VELOCITY OF THE HELICOPTER VARIED; HOWEVER, THE PREPONDERANCE OF WITNESS STATEMENTS REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER INITIALLY WAS HOVERING, BEGAN A ROLLING OSCILLATION, BEGAN TO SPIN (ROTATE ABOUT THE VERTICAL AXIS), AND THEN DESCENDED IN A 45° NOSE DOWN ATTITUDE, WHILE CONTINUING TO SPIN UNTIL IT WAS LOST FROM SIGHT BELOW THE TOPS OF THE SURROUNDING TREES. THEY THEN OBSERVED A PLUME OF SMOKE RISING FROM THE AREA OF THE ACCIDENT SITE.

PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF SECURITY CAMERA VIDEO PROVIDED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CORROBORATED STATEMENTS FROM WITNESSES REGARDING THE ROTATION (SPINNING) OF THE HELICOPTER DURING THE DESCENT, AND THE NOSE DOWN PITCH ATTITUDE.

EXAMINATION OF THE ACCIDENT SITE REVEALED, THAT THE MAIN WRECKAGE HAD COME TO REST UPRIGHT, ON A MAGNETIC HEADING OF 333° IN HEAVILY WOODED TERRAIN, ADJACENT TO A RESIDENCE. THE HELICOPTER FUSELAGE WAS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED FROM IMPACT AND POSTIMPACT FIRE DAMAGE, BUT MOST MAJOR COMPONENTS WERE PRESENT. A DEBRIS FIELD, THAT WAS SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET LONG WAS OBSERVED TO THE WEST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE, WITH SEVERAL PIECES OF DEBRIS COMING TO REST ON THE ROOF OF THE RESIDENCE.

THE DEBRIS FIELD WAS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF SHEET METAL FROM THE TAILBOOM, ALUMINUM HONEYCOMB SANDWICH STRUCTURE FROM THE AIRFRAME, TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SYSTEM PIECES, AND TAIL ROTOR CONTROL TUBE PIECES. THE MAIN WRECKAGE WAS COMPRISED OF THE COCKPIT AND CABIN, BAGGAGE AREA, AND THE FORWARD TAILBOOM ATTACHMENT TO THE MAIN FUSELAGE.

EXAMINATION OF THE HIGH SKID TYPE LANDING GEAR REVEALED THAT THE LEFT LANDING GEAR SKID TUBE WAS FRAGMENTED ABOUT 27 INCHES FROM THE AFT END OF THE TUBE. THE AFT CROSS-MEMBER HAD REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE LEFT LANDING GEAR SKID. THE LEFT LANDING GEAR SKID WAS ALSO FRACTURED FROM THE FORWARD CROSS-MEMBER ABOVE THE TUBE CUFF. THE RIGHT LANDING GEAR SKID WAS FRACTURED FROM THE FORWARD AND AFT CROSS-MEMBERS ABOVE THE CROSS-MEMBER TUBE CUFF. THE RIGHT HIGH STEP, WHICH SPANNED THE LENGTH OF THE RIGHT LANDING GEAR SKID TUBE, WAS FOUND LOOSE IN THE WRECKAGE, AND WAS FRACTURED AT ITS FORWARD AND AFT CROSS-MEMBER ATTACHMENT POINTS. THE AFT LEFT STEP AND THE FORWARD LEFT STEP, LOCATED ON THE CROSS-MEMBER ATTACHMENTS, EXHIBITED A FRACTURED AFT LEFT STEP THAT WAS NOT RECOVERED AND AN INTACT FORWARD LEFT STEP. THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CROSS-MEMBERS, WHICH WERE NORMALLY ATTACHED TO THE LEFT LANDING GEAR SKID TUBE AND CURVED, HAD A MORE FLATTENED APPEARANCE THAN THE RIGHT CROSS-MEMBERS.

EXAMINATION OF THE TAILBOOM REVEALED THAT THE MID-SECTION, WHICH INCLUDED THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER, HAD COME TO REST ADJACENT TO THE FORWARD RIGHT SIDE OF THE NOSE SECTION. THE LEFT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER EXHIBITED AN ANGLED CUT CONSISTENT WITH MAIN ROTOR BLADE CONTACT. THE OUTBOARD FORWARD SLAT WAS SEPARATED FROM THE LEFT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER, AND THE UPPER AND LOWER VERTICAL FIN WERE SEPARATED FROM THE STABILIZER AND FOUND LOOSE IN THE DEBRIS FIELD. THE RIGHT VERTICAL FIN EXHIBITED PARTIAL FRACTURES AT THE UPPER AND LOWER FIN BUT, THE RIGHT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER HAD REMAINED INTACT.

THE TAILBOOM AFT SECTION, WHICH CONTAINED THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX AND TAIL ROTOR, WAS FRACTURED ABOUT 48.5 INCHES FROM THE TAIL ROTOR AXIS OF ROTATION. THE TAILBOOM AFT SECTION CAME TO REST IN A TREE ABOUT 40 FT ABOVE THE GROUND AND 100-150 FT SOUTH-SOUTHWEST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE. THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TAILBOOM AFT SECTION HAD AN IMPACT MARK CONSISTENT WITH CONTACT WITH A TAIL ROTOR BLADE. THE IMPACT MARK WAS LOCATED ABOUT 27-31 INCHES FROM THE TAIL ROTOR AXIS OF ROTATION.

EXAMINATION OF THE MAIN ROTOR REVEALED THAT, ALL FOUR MAIN ROTOR BLADES (BLUE, ORANGE, RED, AND GREEN) WERE PRESENT. THE INBOARD ENDS OF ALL FOUR WERE THERMALLY DAMAGED FROM THE POSTCRASH FIRE, AND EACH DISPLAYED DIFFERING DEGREES OF DAMAGE:

THE WHOLE SPAN OF THE BLUE MAIN ROTOR BLADE WAS FOUND AT THE MAIN WRECKAGE SITE. AN OUTBOARD SECTION (NEAR THE TIP) WAS FRACTURED BUT WAS STILL ATTACHED TO THE BLADE, AND THE BLADE DISPLAYED EVIDENCE OF LOW ROTATIONAL ENERGY AT IMPACT. THE INBOARD END WAS THERMALLY DAMAGED. THE BLADE WAS STILL ATTACHED TO GRIP/SPINDLE, WHICH WAS STILL ATTACHED TO THE HUB. THE PITCH HORN WAS STILL ATTACHED TO GRIP, AND THE PITCH CONTROL LINK (PCL) UPPER ROD END WAS ATTACHED BUT, THE PITCH LINK BODY WAS FRACTURED AND THERMALLY DAMAGED.

THE BLADE SPAN OF THE ORANGE MAIN ROTOR BLADE, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF THE SPAR WAS FOUND AT THE MAIN WRECKAGE SITE. MOST OF THE AFTERBODY WAS MISSING FROM THIS SEGMENT OF BLADE. THE SPAR WAS FRACTURED NEAR THE OUTBOARD END, AND A PORTION OF THE TIP END ABOUT 24 INCHES-LONG WAS FOUND IN THE DEBRIS FIELD. THE BLADE WAS SEPARATED FROM THE GRIP/SPINDLE, AND CAME TO REST NEXT TO THE HUB, WHICH STILL CONTAINED THE GRIP/SPINDLE (BUT WAS LOOSE FROM THE HEAD). THE GRIP/SPINDLE WAS FRACTURED AND EXHIBITED EVIDENCE OF THERMAL DAMAGE. THE PITCH HORN AND PCL UPPER ROD END WAS STILL ATTACHED TO THE GRIP. THE PCL BODY WAS FRACTURED AND THERMALLY DAMAGED.

AN INBOARD SECTION OF THE RED MAIN ROTOR BLADE REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE GRIP/SPINDLE. THE BLADE WAS FRACTURED ABOUT 66 INCHES FROM THE BLADE RETAINING BOLTS, THOUGH A PORTION OF THE SPAR REMAINED, MEASURING ABOUT 78 INCHES IN LENGTH. THIS REMAINING PORTION OF SPAR WAS MISSING ITS AFTERBODY AND THE LEADING-EDGE ABRASION STRIP, THE LATTER OF WHICH WAS FOUND LOOSE IN THE WRECKAGE. A 103-INCH-LONG PIECE OF THE BLADE WAS FOUND UNDER LARGE BRANCHES ABOUT 20 FT SOUTH-SOUTHWEST OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE.

THE PILOT EGRESSED FROM THE HELICOPTER AND SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES. THE FIVE PASSENGERS DID NOT EGRESS AND WERE FATALLY INJURED. THE SCHEDULED 30-MINUTE, DOORS-OFF AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY FLIGHT WAS OPERATED BY LIBERTY HELICOPTERS, INC., ON BEHALF OF FLYNYON UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF TITLE 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS (CFR) PART 91. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED, AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE FLIGHT, WHICH ORIGINATED FROM HELO KEARNY HELIPORT (65NJ), KEARNY, NEW JERSEY ABOUT 1900.

SUMMARY OF PILOT INTERVIEW

ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, AFTER HE ARRIVED AT 65NJ ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, HE PERFORMED A PREFLIGHT INSPECTION OF THE HELICOPTER AND MADE SURE IT WAS FUELED. THE FIRST GROUP OF PASSENGERS FROM FLYNYON WAS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE AT 1100. THE PILOT THEN COMPLETED MULTIPLE 15- TO 30-MINUTE FLIGHTS THAT DAY BUT COULD NOT RECALL HOW MANY.

ABOUT 1845, HE RECEIVED A TEXT MESSAGE FROM FLYNYON OPERATIONS PERSONNEL SCHEDULING THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT. WHEN THE FLYNYON VAN ARRIVED, THE PILOT CHECKED HIS PASSENGERS' HARNESSES AND PUT THEIR LIFE VESTS ON. HE POINTED OUT WHERE THE CUTTING TOOL WAS LOCATED ON THEIR HARNESS AND EXPLAINED HOW TO USE IT. HE THEN SEATED THE PASSENGERS AND SECURED THEIR HARNESS TETHERS TO HARD POINTS ON THE HELICOPTER. AFTER THE PASSENGERS WERE SEATED, LOADING PERSONNEL ASSISTED THEM WITH PUTTING ON THE HELICOPTER'S RESTRAINTS (FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT, ""RESTRAINT"" REFERS TO THE SEABELT AND SHOULDER HARNESS INSTALLED BY THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER, AND ""HARNESS"" REFERS TO THE SYSTEM PROVIDED BY FLYNYON).

BEFORE HE STARTED THE HELICOPTER, THE PILOT PROVIDED A SAFETY BRIEFING THAT INCLUDED WHICH OF THE PASSENGERS WAS GOING TO REMOVE THEIR RESTRAINTS AND WHICH WOULD REMAIN BUCKLED IN THEIR RESTRAINTS DURING THE FLIGHT. HE ASKED THE PASSENGERS TO CONFIRM WHAT SIGHTS THEY WANTED TO SEE, AND THEY PUT THEIR HEADSETS ON. HE FINISHED THE SAFETY BRIEFING AND AGAIN EXPLAINED HOW TO USE THE CUTTING TOOL TO CUT THE SEATBELTS. HE TOLD THEM WHERE THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER WAS AND TOLD THEM THAT IF THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY HE WOULD TELL THE PASSENGERS TO GET BACK INTO THEIR SEATS. HE CONFIRMED THEIR POINTS OF INTEREST AND DID A COMMUNICATIONS CHECK THROUGH THE HEADSETS. THE PASSENGERS COULD HEAR HIM AND RADIO TRAFFIC, BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE MICROPHONES AND COULD NOT SPEAK TO THE PILOT OR EACH OTHER.

SHORTLY AFTER STARTING THE HELICOPTER'S ENGINE, THE PILOT DEPARTED BEHIND TWO OTHER HELICOPTERS AND BEGAN HEADING TOWARD THE STATUE OF LIBERTY AT AN ALTITUDE OF BETWEEN 300 AND 500 FT ABOVE GROUND LEVEL (AGL). DURING FLIGHT, THE OUTBOARD PASSENGERS (LEFT FRONT, LEFT REAR, AND RIGHT REAR) STAYED IN THEIR SEATS AND RESTRAINTS BUT TURNED SIDEWAYS (OUTBOARD) TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS. THE INBOARD PASSENGERS REMOVED THEIR RESTRAINTS BUT REMAINED TETHERED IN THEIR HARNESSES AND SAT ON THE FLOOR WITH THEIR FEET ON THE HELICOPTER'S SKIDS. THEY FLEW AT 500 FT TO THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE BEFORE CONTINUING UP THE EAST RIVER TO CENTRAL PARK. THE PILOT CONTACTED LAGUARDIA AIRPORT AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, AND THE CONTROLLER PROVIDED THE PILOT WITH A TRANSPONDER CODE AND ADVISED HIM TO STAY SOUTH OF THE EXTENDED CENTERLINE OF RUNWAY 22. HE REQUESTED TO FLY AT 2,000 FT AND BEGAN A SHALLOW CLIMB WHILE THE LEFT SIDE PASSENGERS TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF MIDTOWN MANHATTAN. AS THE HELICOPTER NEARED THE EASTERN BOUNDARY OF CENTRAL PARK, THE PILOT SLOWED THE HELICOPTER TO BETWEEN 20 AND 30 KNOTS GROUNDSPEED SO THE PASSENGERS COULD TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS. AT THIS POINT, HE NOTICED THAT THE FRONT PASSENGER'S RESTRAINT WAS HANGING FROM THE SEAT. HE PICKED IT UP, TAPPED THE PASSENGER, AND TOLD HIM TO PUT IT BACK ON, WHICH HE DID. DURING THE INTERVIEW THE PILOT ALSO RECALLED THAT OTHER PASSENGERS HAD INADVERTENTLY RELEASED THEIR SEATBELTS DURING PREVIOUS FLIGHTS.

AS THEY WERE FLYING ALONG THE EASTERN SIDE OF CENTRAL PARK, THE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER TURNED SIDEWAYS, SLID ACROSS THE DOUBLE BENCH SEAT TOWARD THE PILOT, LEANED BACK, AND EXTENDED HIS FEET TO TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS FEET OUTSIDE THE HELICOPTER. AS THE PILOT INITIATED A RIGHT PEDAL TURN TO BEGIN TO HEAD SOUTH, THE NOSE OF THE HELICOPTER BEGAN TO TURN RIGHT FASTER THAN HE EXPECTED, AND HE HEARD A LOW ROTOR RPM ALERT IN HIS HEADSET. HE THEN OBSERVED ENGINE PRESSURE AND FUEL PRESSURE WARNING LIGHTS AND BELIEVED HE HAD EXPERIENCED AN ENGINE FAILURE. HE LOWERED THE COLLECTIVE PITCH CONTROL TO MAINTAIN ROTOR RPM AND LET THE NOSE CONTINUE TO TURN TO THE RIGHT. CENTRAL PARK CAME INTO VIEW AND HE BRIEFLY CONSIDERED LANDING THERE BUT THOUGHT THERE WERE ""TOO MANY PEOPLE."" HE CONTINUED THE TURN BACK TOWARD THE EAST RIVER AND MADE HIS FIRST DISTRESS CALL TO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL. HE YELLED TO THE PASSENGERS TO GET BACK IN THEIR SEATS. DUE TO THE HELICOPTER'S AIRSPEED, HE WAS NOT SURE HE COULD MAKE IT TO THE EAST RIVER AND REDUCED ROTOR RPM SO HE COULD ""GLIDE BETTER."" ONCE HE WAS IN AN ESTABLISHED AUTOROTATIVE GLIDE, HE ATTEMPTED TO RESTART THE ENGINE BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. HE WAITED 1 OR 2 SECONDS AND TRIED THE STARTER AGAIN, BUT THERE WERE NO POSITIVE INDICATIONS OF A SUCCESSFUL ENGINE RESTART ON THE INSTRUMENTATION. HE CHECKED THE FUEL CONTROL LEVER AND FOUND THAT IT WAS STILL IN ITS DETENT FOR NORMAL OPERATION. WHEN HE WAS SURE HE COULD CLEAR THE BUILDINGS AND MAKE IT TO THE RIVER, HE ACTIVATED THE FLOATS AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 800 FT AGL.

AT THIS POINT HE WAS ""COMMITTED TO IMPACT,"" AND, WHEN HE REACHED DOWN FOR THE EMERGENCY FUEL SHUTOFF LEVER, HE REALIZED THAT IT WAS IN THE OFF POSITION. HE ALSO NOTED THAT A PORTION OF THE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER'S TETHER WAS UNDERNEATH THE LEVER.

AS THE HELICOPTER CONTINUED TO DESCEND THROUGH 600 FT AGL, HE POSITIONED THE FUEL SHUTOFF LEVER TO THE ""ON"" POSITION AND ATTEMPTED TO RESTART THE ENGINE. HE OBSERVED POSITIVE INDICATIONS ON THE ENGINE INSTRUMENTS IMMEDIATELY. AS THE HELICOPTER DESCENDED THROUGH 300 FT, HE REALIZED THAT THE ENGINE ""WASN'T SPOOLING UP FAST ENOUGH,"" AND, GIVEN THE HELICOPTER'S PROXIMITY TO THE SURFACE, HE HAD TO CONTINUE THE AUTOROTATION. HE AGAIN REACHED FOR THE FUEL SHUTOFF LEVER AND POSITIONED IT BACK TO ""OFF."" PASSING THROUGH BETWEEN 100 AND 50 FT, HE BEGAN THE CYCLIC FLARE IN AN EXTENDED GLIDE CONFIGURATION, BUT HE ""DID NOT GET A LOT OF RPM BACK."" HE PERFORMED A FLARE REDUCTION AT 10 TO 15 FT. HE PULLED THE COLLECTIVE PITCH CONTROL UP ""AS FAR AS IT WOULD GO."" THE HELICOPTER THEN IMPACTED THE WATER AT 5° TO 10° NOSE-UP ATTITUDE.

AFTER IMPACTING THE WATER, THE CHIN BUBBLE ON THE PILOT'S SIDE BEGAN TO FILL WITH WATER, WHICH QUICKLY COVERED THE FLOOR. HE KEPT HIS RESTRAINT ON AND REACHED DOWN FOR THE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER'S CARABINER ATTACHMENT TO THE HELICOPTER. HE TURNED THE KNURLED SCREW ""TWO OR THREE ROTATIONS""; BY THAT TIME, THE HELICOPTER WAS ""LISTING PAST A 45° ROLL."" HE THEN DECIDED TO EGRESS THE HELICOPTER, AND BY THE TIME HE UNBUCKLED HIS RESTRAINT, HE WAS FULLY UNDER WATER. HE USED TWO HANDS TO GRAB THE DOOR FRAME AND PULL HIMSELF OUT. HE SURFACED ABOUT 4 FT AWAY FROM THE NOSE OF THE HELICOPTER AND CRAWLED UP ONTO THE BELLY. HE STOOD UP AND WAVED FOR HELP BUT COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING.

RECOVERY AND INITIAL EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER

A TUGBOAT WAS THE FIRST VESSEL TO ARRIVE AT THE ACCIDENT SITE, AND THE CREW BEGAN TO RENDER ASSISTANCE. FIRST RESPONDERS LATER ARRIVED, AND SUBSEQUENTLY EXTRICATED THE FIVE PASSENGERS FROM THE HELICOPTER. THE HELICOPTER REMAINED SUBMERGED IN AN INVERTED POSITION IN THE EAST RIVER FOR ABOUT 18 HOURS BEFORE IT WAS RECOVERED AT SLACK TIDE THE FOLLOWING DAY.

EXAMINATION OF THE HELICOPTER REVEALED THAT IT HAD BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED DURING THE IMPACT SEQUENCE. CONTINUITY OF THE FLIGHT CONTROLS WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE CYCLIC, COLLECTIVE, MAIN ROTOR SERVOS, AND THE MAIN ROTOR HEAD. THE CYCLIC, COLLECTIVE, AND PEDAL CONTROL TUBES UNDERNEATH THE COCKPIT FLOOR REMAINED INTACT. NO EVIDENCE OF BLOCKAGES OR FOREIGN OBJECT DEBRIS WAS OBSERVED ON THE ENGINE AIR INLET BARRIER FILTER. CONTINUITY OF DRIVE WAS CONFIRMED BETWEEN THE ENGINE POWER TURBINE AND THE MAIN ROTOR HEAD. THE RED MAIN ROTOR BLADE REMAINED ATTACHED TO ITS RESPECTIVE SLEEVE AND WAS FRACTURED CHORDWISE ABOUT 4 FT FROM THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE ATTACHMENT BOLTS. THE BLUE AND YELLOW BLADES WERE ATTACHED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE SLEEVES AND WERE DAMAGED. ALL THREE-MAIN ROTOR BLADE PITCH CHANGE LINKS REMAINED ATTACHED AT THEIR RESPECTIVE PITCH HORN AND ROTATING SWASHPLATE. THE VIBRATION ABSORBER REMAINED INSTALLED ON TOP OF THE MAIN ROTOR HEAD.

BOTH TAIL ROTOR BLADES REMAINED ATTACHED TO THEIR HUB. ONE TAIL ROTOR BLADE EXHIBITED A CHORDWISE FRACTURE ABOUT 6 INCHES FROM ITS ROOT END. THE PITCH LINK OF THIS BLADE WAS BENT NEAR THE OUTBOARD ROD END. THE SECOND TAIL ROTOR BLADE WAS GENERALLY INTACT, AND ITS PITCH LINKS DID NOT EXHIBIT DEFORMATION. ROTATION OF THE TAIL ROTOR RESULTED IN ROTATION OF THE ALUMINUM TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT'S FORWARD RIVETED CONNECTION, BUT THE SHAFT ROTATED WITHIN THE EXTERNAL SPLINED ADAPTER. THE EXTERNAL SPLINED ADAPTER REMAINED CONNECTED TO THE INTERNAL-SPLINED [FLANGE] ADAPTER AND WAS CONTINUOUS THROUGH THE STEEL TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT TO THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE OUTPUT FLANGE TO THE ENGINE REDUCTION GEARBOX. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF BINDING WHEN MANUALLY ROTATING THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE.

THE FUEL FLOW CONTROL LEVER WAS FOUND IN THE OFF POSITION. THE FUEL SHUTOFF LEVER WAS FOUND IN THE OPEN POSITION. THE SNAPWIRE (WITNESS WIRE) BETWEEN THE FUEL SHUTOFF LEVER AND THE ENGINE CONTROL HOUSING WAS BROKEN AT ITS LOWER END WHERE IT WAS NORMALLY SECURED THROUGH A HOLE IN THE CONTROL HOUSING.

THE COLLECTIVE STICK WAS IN ITS NORMALLY INSTALLED POSITION. THE COLLECTIVE POSITION WAS NEARLY FULL DOWN. THE COLLECTIVE FRICTION LOCK WAS ABLE TO BE ROTATED BY HAND. THE CYCLIC STICK WAS IN ITS NORMALLY INSTALLED POSITION. THE CYCLIC POSITION WAS FOUND TO BE AFT RIGHT. THE CYCLIC FRICTION LOCK WAS ABLE TO BE EASILY ROTATED BY HAND. THE COLLECTIVE LEVER LOCK WAS IN ITS STOWED POSITION ON THE CENTER CONSOLE. BOTH PEDALS WERE FOUND IN THEIR NORMALLY INSTALLED POSITION. THE RIGHT PEDAL POSITION WAS NEARLY FULL-FORWARD WITH A CORRESPONDING AFT POSITION OF THE LEFT PEDAL. THE PEDALS COULD NOT BE MANUALLY ACTUATED. A PORTABLE FIRE EXTINGUISHER WAS FOUND LOOSE IN THE FRONT-RIGHT CHIN BUBBLE.

EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED THAT THE ENGINE WAS STILL MOUNTED IN THE HELICOPTER AND THE COWLING WAS INTACT. THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF OIL OR FUEL LEAKS, FIRE, OR UNCONTAINMENT. THE EXHAUST DUCT WAS INTACT AND UNDAMAGED. THE POWER TURBINE WHEEL COULD BE ROTATED EASILY, BUT ONLY IN THE FREE-WHEELING DIRECTION, WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNAL CONTINUITY AS WELL AS AN INTACT AND OPERATING ROTOR CLUTCH. THE TRAILING EDGES OF THE POWER TURBINE BLADES WERE EXAMINED THROUGH THE EXHAUST DUCT AND WERE ALL PRESENT AND UNDAMAGED. THE GAS GENERATOR (GG) SPOOL WAS ACCESSED BY REACHING INTO THE AIR INLET DUCT AND TURNING THE AXIAL COMPRESSOR WHEEL. THE GG SPOOL COULD BE ROTATED EASILY BY HAND; HOWEVER, A FAINT SCRATCHING NOISE COULD BE HEARD FROM THE CORE, CONSISTENT WITH CORROSION DUE TO SALT WATER CONTACT ON THE SHAFT BEARINGS. THE FOUR MAGNETIC OIL CHIP DETECTORS WERE REMOVED AND FOUND ABSENT OF DEBRIS. THE OIL FILTER BYPASS INDICATOR WAS NOT TRIGGERED INDICATING NO BLOCKAGE IN THE OIL FILTER. THE FUEL SUPPLY LINE FROM THE FIREWALL TO THE FUEL PUMP WAS DISCONNECTED AT THE FIREWALL FITTING AND FUEL WAS OBSERVED TO DRAIN FROM THE LINE.

EXAMINATION OF THE EMERGENCY FLOAT SYSTEM REVEALED THAT THE THREE FLOATS INSTALLED ON THE LEFT LANDING GEAR SKID APPEARED TO BE MORE INFLATED THAN THE FLOATS ON THE RIGHT LANDING GEAR SKID. THE EMERGENCY FLOATS' LEFT PRESSURIZED GAS CYLINDER GAUGE INDICATED ABOUT 0 PSI, WHILE THE RIGHT PRESSURIZED GAS CYLINDER GAUGE INDICATED ABOUT 4,000 PSI. A FUNCTIONAL CHECK WAS PERFORMED BY ACTUATING THE CYCLIC TRIGGER (WHICH IS WHAT IS USED TO ACTIVATE THE FLOATS). THE TRIGGER MECHANISM WAS SMOOTH WITH NO EVIDENCE OF BINDING. CONTINUITY OF THE FLOAT SYSTEM CONTROL WAS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE TRIGGER, DUAL CABLE BLOCK, AND THE ACTIVATION CABLE CLEVIS CONNECTION. WHEN THE TRIGGER WAS RELEASED, THE DUAL CABLE BLOCK RETURNED TO ITS NORMAL POSITION (VIA SPRING WITHIN THE JUNCTION BOX) BUT THE UPPER AND LOWER TURNBUCKLES REMAINED IN THEIR ACTUATED POSITIONS.

EXAMINATION OF THE SEATS AND RESTRAINT SYSTEMS REVEALED THAT THE FIVE PASSENGERS ONBOARD THE HELICOPTER WERE PROVIDED WITH AIRFRAME MANUFACTURER-INSTALLED RESTRAINTS, AS WELL AS A FULL BODY HARNESS. THE HARNESS SYSTEM WAS NOT INSTALLED BY THE HELICOPTER MANUFACTURER AND WAS COMPRISED OF OFF-THE-SHELF COMPONENTS CONSISTING OF A NYLON FALL-PROTECTION HARNESS THAT WAS ATTACHED AT THE OCCUPANTS' BACK BY A LOCKING CARABINER TO A LANYARD. THE LANYARD WAS COMPOSED OF MULTIPLE WOVEN FABRIC LOOPS, AND THE OPPOSITE END OF THE LANYARD WAS SECURED BY ANOTHER LOCKING CARABINER TO A HARD POINT ON THE HELICOPTER. A SMALL POUCH WAS ATTACHED TO THE HARNESS AND CONTAINED A CUTTING TOOL. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, AT THE END OF EACH FLIGHT, FLYNYON PERSONNEL WOULD UNSCREW THE LOCKING CARABINER LOCATED ON THE BACK OF THE PASSENGERS' HARNESSES SO THAT THE PASSENGERS COULD EGRESS.

THE WRECKAGE WAS RETAINED BY THE NTSB FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION.",,

THE COMMERCIAL PILOT ON-BOARD THE HELICOPTER AND ONE RESIDENT IN THE BUILDING WERE FATALLY INJURED. DAY VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT THE TIME, AND NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR THE FLIGHT, WHICH ORIGINATED FROM WILLIAMSBURG-JAMESTOWN AIRPORT (JGG), WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA ABOUT 1640 AND WAS DESTINED FOR STAFFORD REGIONAL AIRPORT (RMN), STAFFORD, VIRGINIA. THE HELICOPTER WAS PRIVATELY OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE COMMERCIAL PILOT UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF TITLE 14 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS PART 91.

THE PILOT HAD FLOWN FROM RMN TO THE JGG EARLIER THAT MORNING TO ATTEND A MEETING AT THE AIRPORT. AIRPORT PERSONNEL REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER HAD BEEN REFUELED, TOPPING OFF BOTH FUEL TANKS, PRIOR TO DEPARTURE FROM JGG.

REVIEW OF PRELIMINARY FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL RADAR DATA SHOW THE HELICOPTER DEPARTED JGG ABOUT 1630, AND THEN HEADED NORTH TOWARD THE ACCIDENT SITE. THE HELICOPTER CLIMBED TO A PRESSURE ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 1,700 FEET. AFTER REACHING 1,700 FEET, THE HELICOPTER LEVELED OFF, AND THE GROUNDSPEED INCREASED FROM ABOUT 60 KNOTS TO ABOUT 110 KNOTS OVER THE NEXT 1.5 MINUTES. THE HELICOPTER THEN ENTERED A RIGHT DECREASING RADIUS TURN, WHILE DESCENDING, UNTIL TRACKING COVERAGE WAS LOST.  AT THE LAST RECORDED POSITION, THE HELICOPTER WAS IN THE VACINITY OF THE ACCIDENT SITE, DESCENDING AT A RATE GREATER THAN 10,000 FEET PER MINUTE.

SEVERAL WITNESSES NEAR THE ACCIDENT SITE DESCRIBED THE HELICOPTER AS FLYING LOW, ONE ESTIMATED ITS HEIGHT AT ABOUT 100 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND, AS IT APPROACHED THE TWO-STORY CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX. THEY DESCRIBED IT AS FLYING RELATIVELY STRAIGHT AND LEVEL OR SLIGHTLY DESCENDING, BEFORE SUDDENLY PITCHING NOSE DOWN AND DESCENDING INTO THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING. ONE WITNESS DESCRIBED THE HELICOPTER AS ""ROCKING BACK AND FORTH UNSTEADILY"" JUST BEFORE IT PITCHED DOWNWARD. ANOTHER WITNESS LOCATED ABOUT 100 YARDS SOUTH OF ACCIDENT SITE RECALLED THE ENGINE MAKING A ""CONSTANT SOUND"" AS IT FLEW OVER HIS HEAD.

THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED A TWO-STORY 10 UNIT CONDOMINIUM BUILDING LOCATED ABOUT 3 NAUTICAL MILES NORTH OF JGG. THE MAIN WRECKAGE CAME TO REST INSIDE THE NORTH END OF THE BUILDING, WITH SOME COMPONENTS INCLUDING A SECTION OF THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT FOUND ALONG THE 70-FOOT WRECKAGE PATH EXTENDING FROM THE BUILDING ON A HEADING OF ABOUT 20° MAGNETIC.

EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED THAT ALL THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE HELICOPTER WERE PRESENT AT THE ACCIDENT SITE EXCEPT FOR THE TAIL BOOM, THE TAIL ROTOR, AND TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX. THE VERTICAL STABILIZER AND AFT BULKHEAD AND A SECTION OF THE TAIL ROTOR GUARD WERE LOCATED, HOWEVER FIRE AND BUILDING COLLAPSE DAMAGE PREVENTED ACCESS TO SEVERAL AREAS SURROUNDING THE MAIN WRECKAGE. MANY OF THE COMPONENTS WERE PARTIALLY OR COMPLETELY CONSUMED BY A POST-CRASH FIRE. REMNANTS OF THE REMOVABLE COPILOT SIDE CONTROLS WERE FOUND NEAR THEIR STOWED POSITION. REMNANTS OF ALL THE PILOT SIDE CONTROLS WERE PRESENT. ALL HYDRAULIC CONTROLS WERE IDENTIFIED WITH PORTIONS OF ALL THE PUSH-PULL RODS EXTENDING FROM THE HYDRAULIC ACTUATORS. PORTIONS OF THE FLIGHT CONTROL RODS WERE THERMALLY DAMAGED. ALL MAIN AND TAIL ROTOR FLIGHT CONTROL ROD ENDS WERE SECURE TO THEIR ATTACHMENT POINTS AT BOTH ENDS, EXCEPT FOR THE TAIL ROTOR GEAR BOX CONNECTION WHICH WAS NOT RECOVERED. THE TRANSMISSION INPUT SHEAVE (PULLY) WAS MANUALLY ROTATED IN BOTH THE LOCKING AND FREEWHEELING MODES, AND THE MAIN ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT ROTATED WITH THE SHEAVE, WITH SOME INTERFERENCE FROM A DAMAGED FLEX COUPLING. A SCORE MARK ON THE AFT FACE OF THE UPPER SHEAVE WAS ABOUT 4 INCHES LONG IN THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION. THE LEADING EDGES OF BOTH MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE DENTED AND BENT IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS AND REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE ROTOR HUB. ABOUT 1 FOOT OF EACH TIP OF BOTH BLADE SPARS WERE NOT RECOVERED AND MOST OF THE REMAINDER OF THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE CONSUMED BY FIRE. THE TAIL ROTOR GEARBOX MOUNTING BOLTS WERE FRACTURED CONSISTENT WITH OVERLOAD. THE TRANSMISSION CONTINUITY WAS CONFIRMED FROM THE UPPER SHEAVE TO THE MAIN ROTOR MAST AND TO THE INTERMEDIATE FLEX COUPLING.  THE MAIN AND AUXILIARY FUEL TANKS WERE SEVERELY DAMAGED. THE CAP ON THE MAIN TANK WAS IN PLACE, THE CAP ON THE AUXILIARY TANK WAS MISSING. PORTIONS OF THE MAIN AND AUXILIARY FUEL TANKS WERE CONSUMED BY POST-CRASH FIRE.

THE ENGINE CRANKSHAFT WAS ROTATED FREELY BY HAND. BOTH OIL COOLERS, ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE ENGINE, EXHIBITED GRINDING DAMAGE IN LINE WITH THE STARTER RING GEAR. THUMB COMPRESSION AND SUCTION WERE PRESENT ON ALL CYLINDERS, THOUGH WEAKER ON CYLINDER NO. 5. THE CYLINDER HEAD AND INTAKE PIPE FOR CYLINDER NO. 5 RECEIVED IMPACT DAMAGE, AND DEBRIS WAS FOUND IN THE INTAKE. ALL SPARK PLUGS EXHIBITED NORMAL WEAR AND COLORATION AS COMPARED TO THE CHAMPION CHECK-A-PLUG CHART, THE NUMBER 4 AND 6 BOTTOM SPARK PLUGS WERE OIL-SOAKED.  BOTH MAGNETOS WERE IMPACT AND FIRE DAMAGED AND COULD NOT BE TESTED. BORESCOPE INSPECTION OF ALL CYLINDERS DID NOT REVEAL ANY DAMAGE OR SCORING MARKS ON PISTON TOPS, CYLINDER WALLS OR VALVES. THE FUEL INJECTION SERVO INLET SCREEN WAS FREE OF DEBRIS. THE BUTTERFLY VALVE WAS FOUND IN THE FULL OPEN POSITION HOWEVER THE INPUT CONTROL ROD WAS DAMAGED AND NOT CONNECTED, THE MIXTURE CONTROL ACTUATOR WAS TOO DAMAGED TO DETERMINE ITS POSITION. THE MIXTURE CONTROL KNOB IN THE COCKPIT WAS FOUND IN THE FULL RICH POSITION. ALL SIX FUEL INJECTOR NOZZLES WERE FOUND UNOBSTRUCTED.
